<p>This Series opens with a new work by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Edward Thomas</span>, that curious and enthusiastic
explorer of the English Countryside, whose
prose style gives him a claim to be regarded
as the successor, as he is the biographer, of
Richard Jefferies. The Series includes a new
edition of Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas’s</span> other work, “The
Heart of England,” and Mr. <span class="smcap">Hilaire Belloc’s</span>
“The Historic Thames.” These two
volumes were originally issued in limited

<h2>NOTE</h2>


<p>Of the five songs printed at the end of this
book, only “La Fille du Roi” has been
published before, I believe. “The Holm
Bank Hunting Song” and “Poor Old
Horse” were sung by competitors for folk-song
prizes at the annual Westmoreland
Musical Festival, and I owe them to the
kindness of Mr. George Rathbone. “The
Mowing Song” and “Mary, come into the
Field,” were given to me by friends.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon had perfected the silence of the
suburban street. Every one had gone into his house to
tea; none had yet started for church or promenade; the
street was empty, except for a white pigeon that pecked
idly in the middle of the road and once leaned upon one
wing, raised the other so as to expose her tender side and
took the rain deliciously; so calm and unmolested was
the hour.</p>

<p>The houses were in unbroken rows and arranged in
pairs, of which one had a bay window on the ground
floor and one had not. Some had laurels in front; some
had names. But they were so much alike that the street
resembled a great storehouse where yards of goods, all of
one pattern, are exposed, all with that painful lack of
character that makes us wish to rescue one and take it
away and wear it, and soil it, and humanise it rapidly.</p>

<p>Soon a boy of nine years old came out of one house
and stood at the gate. At first he moved briskly and
looked in every direction as if expecting to see some one
whom he knew; but in a little while he paused and merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
looked towards the pigeon, so fixedly that perhaps he saw
it not. The calm silenced him, took him into its bosom,
yet also depressed him. Had he dared, he would have
shouted or run; he would have welcomed the sound of
a piano, of a dog barking, of a starling coldly piping.
While he still paused an old man rounded the corner of
the street and came down in the roadway towards him.</p>

<p>The old man was small and straight, and to his thin
figure the remains of a long black coat and grey trousers
adhered with singular grace. You could not say that he
was well dressed, but rather that he was in the penultimate
stage of a transformation like Dryope’s or Daphne’s,
which his pale face had not altogether escaped. His
neglected body seemed to have grown this grey rind
that flapped like birch bark. Had he been born in it the
clothing could not have been more apt. The eye travelled
from these clothes with perfect satisfaction&mdash;as from a
branch to its fruit&mdash;to his little crumpled face and its
partial crust of hair. Yet he walked. One hand on a
stick, the other beneath a basket of watercress, he walked
with quick, short steps, now and then calling out unexpectedly,
as if in answer to a question, “Watercresses!”
No one interrupted him. He was hungry; he nibbled
at pieces of cress with his gums, and so kneaded his face
as if it had been dough. He passed the boy; he stooped,
picked up a rotten apple, and in the act frightened the
pigeon, which rose, as the boy saw, and disappeared.</p>

<p>The boy raised his head and watched. He saw the
old man&mdash;as in an eloquent book and not with his own
usually indolent eyes&mdash;and thought him a traveller.
Yes! that was how a traveller looked&mdash;a strange, free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
man, hatless, walking in the road, ignoring puddles,
talking carelessly to himself; from the country&mdash;such
was his stick and the manner of his clothes; with something
magnificent and comely in his hoariness; sleeping
the boy knew not where, perhaps not at all, but going on
and on, certainly not to church, but perhaps to places with
mountains, icebergs, houses in the branches of trees, great
waters, camels, monkeys, crocodiles, parrots, ivory, cannibals,
curved swords. And the boy flushed to think that
the quiet street was an avenue to all the East, the Pole,
the Amazon ... to dark men who wondered about the
sunlight, the wind, the rain, and whence they came ...
to towns set down in the heart of forests and lonely as
ships at sea. But whatever he was, the old man was more
blessed than any one whom the boy had ever seen.</p>

<p>The old man was gone out of sight. The boy started
to run and follow; but he stumbled and fell and uttered
his intolerable longing in a fit of grave tears, while the
street began to be bright and restless again.</p>

<p>I thought to follow him myself. But the next day I
was still in that grey land, looking at it from a railway
train.</p>

<p>The hundreds of streets parallel or at angles with the
railway&mdash;some exposing flowery or neglected back gardens,
bedrooms half seen through open windows, pigeon houses
with pigeons bowing or flashing in flight, all manner of
domesticities surprised&mdash;others a line of shop fronts and
gorgeous or neat or faded women going to and fro&mdash;others,
again, a small space that had been green and was
still grassy under its encumbrance of dead trees, scaffolding
and bricks&mdash;some with inns having good names&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
streets are the strangest thing in the world. They have
never been discovered. They cannot be classified. There
is no tradition about them. Poets have not shown how
we are to regard them. They are to us as mountains
were in the Middle Ages, sublime, difficult, immense;
and yet so new that we have inherited no certain attitude
towards them, of liking or dislike. They suggest so much
that they mean nothing at all. The eye strains at them
as at Russian characters which are known to stand for
something beautiful or terrible; but there is no translator:
it sees a thousand things which at the moment of seeing
are significant, but they obliterate one another. More
than battlefield or library, they are dense with human
life. They are as multitudinous and painful and unsatisfying
as the stars. They propose themselves as a problem
to the mind, only a little less so at night when their
surfaces hand the mind on to the analogies of sea waves
or large woods.</p>

<p>Nor at the end of my journey was the problem solved.
It was a land of new streets and half-built streets and
devastated lanes. Ivied elm trunks lay about with scaffold
poles, uprooted shrubs were mingled with bricks, mortar
with turf, shining baths and sinks and rusty fire grates
with dead thistles and thorns. Here and there a man in
a silk hat or a little girl with neat ankles and high brown
boots stepped amidst the deeply rutted mud. An artist
who wished to depict the Fall and some sympathy with
it in the face of a ruined Eden might have had little to
do but copy an acre of the surviving fields.</p>

<p>A north wind swept the land clean. In the hedges
and standing trees, it sobbed at intervals like a bitter child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
forcing himself to cry; in the windowless houses it made
a merrier sound like a horn. It drove workmen and
passers-by to spend as much time as possible in “The King’s
Head,” and there the medley of the land was repeated.
Irish and Cockney accents mingled with Kentish;
Americans would have been out of place. No one
seemed to dislike the best room in the inn, where there
was a piano, a coloured picture of Lord Roberts and of
the landlord as a youth, an old print of snipe-shooting,
some gaudy and fanciful advertisements of spirits, and no
fire to warm the wall-paper which had once had a pattern
characteristic of poor bathrooms.</p>

<p>I felt a kind of exalted and almost cheerful gloom as I
stepped out and saw that it was raining and would go on
raining. O exultation of the sorrowful heart when Nature
also seems to be sorrowing! What strange merriment
is this which the dejected mind and the wind in the
trees are making together! What high lavolt of the
shuffling heels of despair! As two lovers wounded and
derided will make of their complainings one true joy that
triumphs, so will the concealing rain and the painful
mind.</p>

<p>The workmen had gone; faint lights began to appear
through the blinds of the finished houses. There was no
sunset, no change from day to night. The end of the
day was like what is called a natural death in bed; an
ill-laid fire dies thus. With the darkness a strange spirit
of quiet joy appeared in the air. Old melodies floating
about it on that mourning wind. The rain formed a
mist and a veil over the skeletons round about, but it
revealed more than it took away; Nature gained courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in the gloom. The rain smoothed her as it will wash
away tears on the lonely hills. The trees were back in
Eden again. They were as before in their dim, stately
companies. The bad walking was no annoyance. Once
I came upon a line of willows above dead reeds that used
to stand out by a pond as the first notice to one walking
out of London that he was in the country at last; they
were unchanged; they welcomed and encouraged once
more. The lighted windows in the mist had each a
greeting; they were as the windows we strain our eyes
for as we descend to them from the hills of Wales or
Kent; like those, they had the art of seeming a magical
encampment among the trees, brave, cheerful lights
which men and women kept going amidst the dense and
powerful darkness. The thin, incompleted walls learned
a venerable utterance.</p>

<p>The night grew darker. The sound of pianos mingled
with the wind. I could not see the trees&mdash;I was entrapped
in a town where I had once known nothing but fields
and one old house, stately and reticent among the limes.
A sense of multitude surged about and over me&mdash;of
multitudes entirely unknown to me&mdash;collected by chance&mdash;mere
numbers&mdash;human faces that were at that moment
expressing innumerable strange meanings with which I
had nothing to do. Had I said to one who entered an
adjacent house that I was retrospectively a lodger of his,
since I had once hidden for half a day in the hollow oak
in his front garden, he would have stared. Here were
people living in no ancient way. That they supped and
slept in their houses was all that was clear to me. I
wondered why&mdash;why did they go on doing these things?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Did they ever sit up thinking and thinking, trying to
explain to themselves why they were there, and then fall
asleep in their chairs and awake still with the same goalless
thought and so go shivering to bed? The window
lights were now as strange to me and as fascinating as, to
a salmon swaying by a bridge, the lights and faces of the
poachers on the bank. As if it were new came back to
me the truism that most men are prisons to themselves.
Here was a city imprisoned deep, and I as deep, in the
rain. Was there, perhaps, joy somewhere on account of
those thousands of prisoners and lighted windows?</p>

<p>I left London that night on foot. By way of preparation,
I stayed until after midnight to listen to a sweet
voice that drew upon all the gloom and jangle of London
the sweet patterns of some old country melodies. Strange
and pleasant it was to look out upon the London night
of angry-ridged, tumultuous roofs, and then, sharply
drawing a curtain, to live upon a cadence, a <span class="lock">melody&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“As I walked forth one Midsummer morning</div>
       <div class="verse">A-viewing the meadow and to take the air ...”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A pure rose upon a battlefield, a bright vermeil shell
upon a slatternly sea-shore after storm, would not be of
a more piercing beauty than those songs just there.</p>

<p>Then I set out and began to stain the immense silence
of the city with the noise of my heels and stick. A
journalist or two went by; a fat man and his fat dog
straying from the neat bar of a Conservative Club homewards
without precipitancy; a few pleasure-seekers with
bleared or meditative eye; a youth with music in his
steps, fresh from some long evening of talk and song,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
perhaps his first. Here was a policeman stern and
expectant in a dark entry, or smoking a pipe; there
stood or sat or leaned or lay men and women who no
more give up their secrets than the blinded windows and
the doors that will not be knocked at for hours yet.
How noble the long, well-lighted streets at this hour,
fit with their smooth paved ways for some roaring game,
and melancholy because there is no one playing. The
rise and fall of the land is only now apparent. In the
day we learn of hills in London only by their fatigue;
in the night we can see them as if the streets did not
exist, as they must have appeared to men who climbed
them with a hope of seeing their homes from the summits
or of surprising a stag beneath. The river ran by, grim,
dark and vast, and having been untouched by history, old
as hills and stars, it seemed from a bridge, not like a wild
beast in a pit, but like a strange, reminiscential amulet,
worn by the city to remind her that she shall pass. How
tameless and cold the water, alien, careless, monstrous,
capable of drowning in a little while the uttermost agony
or joy and making them as if they had never been. I
passed by doors where lived people whom I knew, but it
was two o’clock in the morning; they could not know
me. I wondered which of them I could safely disturb.
With what expression would they come down from their
warm beds and oblivion, with dull, puzzled eyes, and
slowly recall those things which&mdash;even the pleasant ones&mdash;our
lonely lives so often reduce to mere entries in a
tedious chronicle. I left the question unanswered.</p>

<p>Now I saw a tall, stiff crane surmounting the houses
and nodding in the sky, itself simple, strong, direct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
weighing the city against the heavens in an enormous
balance with Rhadamanthine solemnity.</p>

<p>Endless were the vast caves and deserts of the streets,
most strange the unobserved, innumerable things prepared
for the eyes of men on the coming day&mdash;glittering
windows of cutlery, food, drugs, sadlery&mdash;the high walls
with coloured advertisements of beer, medicine, food,
actors, newspapers, corsets, concerts, pickles. The dark
windows, the windows lit to serve some purpose unknown,
seemed to make it necessary to cry out, to raise an alarm,
to make sure that the darkness or light meant only the
usual things. Now and then several streets ran towards
one another and left a square or irregular space at their
meeting, surrounded by an inn with a sign, a stone
trough, an old eighteenth-century house, its windows
emphasised by white paint, a row of pollarded limes, a
scrap of orchard&mdash;once perhaps the heart of a village.
Or for almost a mile the streets ran straight, with
branches at right angles, and suddenly a large house stood
back and its garden of limes and lawn broke the
monotone. The names of the streets were an epitome
of the world and time, commemorating famous and
unknown men, battles, conspiracies, far-off cities and
rivers, little villages known to me, streams and hills now
buried by houses; the names of the inns were as rich as
the titles of books in an old library, suggested many an
inn by wood and mill and meadow and village square,
but all confused as if in a marine store. And as I walked
through old and new villages, rents, courts, alleys, lanes,
rises, streets, buildings, roads, avenues, I seemed to be
travelling through the Inferno and Purgatorio, but before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the first man had entered them and without a guide. It
was immense, sublime, but its purposes dark and not to
be explained by the policemen here and there in charge.
Nor, passing through Battersea, did I meet the famous
man who has threaded this mystery. He, at least, would
have taken me to a housetop and have unravelled space;
but I expected him at street corners and on commons in
vain. But presently I reached a sign-post that stood
boldly up with undoubted inscriptions, one of them to
London, and away from that I set my face, though I
saw market-carts going the way I had come, with drowsy
carters, one lamp, and horses whose shadowy muscles
quivered in the electric light. That sign-post seemed to
make all things clear. Like a prophet it rose up, who
after an age of darkness says that the path of life and
goodness is plain, that he knows it, and that all who
follow him will be saved. Not for him hesitation and
qualification; but to all men perplexed by definitions,
testimonies, other prophets and their own thoughts, he
cries: “This is the way.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“The world may find the Spring by following her.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I followed and needed only a good marching song. By
chance I lighted on one which was first sung by countrymen.
It is not triumphant&mdash;the mind wearies of a
triumphant song in solitude and at night&mdash;but it persists
and acknowledges no end. It was made by feeble,
mighty-limbed men who knew what it is to go on and
on for ends which they do not entirely apprehend. It
matches the hurrying feet of the lover or the limp of the
hungry man at dawn. It <span class="lock">begins&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>It goes <span class="lock">on&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>It goes on until a hundred is reached, proceeding after
twenty by tens. And so, gradually, as the song went
on, the houses opened apart, and the road ahead was a
simple white line. On either hand thousands of lights
showed valleys and hills; but ahead there was a promising
darkness, and out of it came the Watercress Man with a
basket of wild flowers on his back.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, setting down his flowers slowly, “the
price of a pint of ale won’t hurt you, I suppose? I have
drunk nothing since yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>“But have you eaten anything?” I asked, ready to
admire him for asking first for drink.</p>

<p>“No,” said he, “I have neither eaten nor drunken. I
drink four ale.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, when I had given him twopence
for drink and twopence for food. “We are all
sons of one mother. You can’t get away from that.”</p>

<p>“Then we are brothers,” said I.</p>

<p>“Certainly, if you will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should like to know you.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, if you can.”</p>

<p>“What are you by profession?”</p>

<p>“A hard question. I profess nothing. By conviction
I am an ill-used man, and for the moment I am a seller
of flowers.”</p>

<p>He showed me his flowers&mdash;kingcups, cuckoo flowers,
primroses from the moist woods.</p>

<p>“I will buy your flowers,” I said.</p>

<p>“No! I think I shall keep those,” and he put them
in a horse trough close by. I asked him if he would
return into the country with me.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, “it would be sunrise before we got
into the country, and I never spend the daytime in the
country if I can avoid it.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>

<p>“As we are brothers,” he said, “I will tell you that
I paint landscapes. I like nothing on earth so well as
the country. I was dragged up in the Borough. The
country for me! But the lover of Nature and the
gamekeeper and the farmer and the landowner spoil it
by day. The people are stupid, brutal. The women
are not at all beautiful. Their cowsheds are the only
things they have not spoilt: they are still sweet. As a
lad I read the pastoral poets, and I know that these
things were once far different. So I live in London and
paint landscapes at sixpence a-piece, sometimes four or
five of them in a morning, so that I live well. I usually
put a few red flowers in with the sixpennyworth. I am
sixty-eight; my son will succeed me, but badly&mdash;badly.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because he says that he paints Nature as she is, which
is impossible. I make no such mistake, as you shall see&mdash;&mdash;I
aim for suggestion. Here,” he said, producing one from
his pocket (a brown field sloping up to a ridge of trees,
painted black, against a silvery sky, and in that a few rooks).
“Do you not hear there the wild, angry charm of hundreds
of blackbirds and thrushes and larks? They sometimes
make me lie down and cry before the sun rises, because I
am not worthy; I do not own a little farm and drive
my own plough and cause the envy of kings at my
happiness.”</p>

<p>“Is that clump of trees right?” I asked (in need of
something to say).</p>

<p>“Right? But the feeling is there. Is it not cold and
pure and wild? I felt great as I did that. But see here
again!”</p>

<p>Here he brought out another, also in three colours, of
a landscape at dawn. Three black firs stood at the top of
a steep down, and from them went a pair of dark birds
out along a silver sky.</p>

<p>“I never put figures in my landscapes,” he explained,
“but is not the spirit of a small sweet Amaryllis in it?
<em>Ah! lovely as thou art to look upon, ah, heart of stone, ah,
dark-browed maiden!</em> Does she not hide somewhere out
of the picture; and does not a shepherd, seated perhaps
under those fir trees, look for her coming? Is not the
Golden Age in that sky?”</p>

<p>“I am glad,” said I, “that you believe in a Golden Age.
Literature and art are continually recreating it for us.”</p>

<p>“Modern literature,” he said scornfully, “is by those
who have not seen for those who do not care. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
answer has literature to this?” Here he showed a third
sketch.</p>

<p>“I know nothing of literature,” I said; “I am a
journalist.”</p>

<p>He sighed with relief, and pointed to a yellow thatched
house with windows open on to the sea, and behind the
house the usual dark trees and silver sky.</p>

<p>“There,” he exclaimed, “literature does not believe in
or understand the honest life, bound up with the seasons
and beauty which is expressed by that simple scene. See,
there, equal laws, harmony, aims unspotted by the world,
not fearing nor loving kings. Any thoughtful man living
in a scene like that would be wiser, and it would be impossible
for him to err. I myself would venture to be a
Daphnis or Menalcas again there. I can hear the one
living pastoral poet saying in that cottage by the <span class="lock">sea&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Come, pretty Phyllis, you are late!</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>He knew all four verses by heart.</p>

<p>“Your aims are wonderful,” I stammered. “If I could
only see you at work, if you would only show me the scenes
which inspire such antique and lofty emotions....”</p>

<p>“See! this is London&mdash;nothing but trees&mdash;I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
it so as I came home. But I cannot go with you. I
return to think about the Golden Age.”</p>

<p>He tied the flowers round the pole of a signboard that
stood on a harsh courtyard of gravel strewn with dirty
paper, and pursued his homeward road, eager for “The
Old Angel” or “The Chequers” where he could vivify
his vision of the Golden Age.</p>

<p>In the sky, the distant dawn sent up to the clouds a
faint dream of light that made their shapes just visible.
A hedge-sparrow awoke in the furze beside the road,
twittered clearly and became silent again; on the other
side, in some invisible trees high up, a few rooks began
to talk. Then, for a little while as I went on, the darkness
was complete, and the silence also, except that the
telegraph wires forced a faint complaint out of the light
wind.</p>

<p>As the clouds filled with that dream of light and the
road began visibly to lengthen out, I left London behind
or recognised it only in the blue bowls and copper-ware
gleaming through the windows of new houses round
about. Beyond them rolled a ploughed country of such
abounding and processional curves that it seemed almost
to move and certainly to rejoice; here and there the
curves dimpled suddenly and made a hollow, where elm
or beech sprang up in the midst of the ploughland, in a
small consistory, grave, shining, fair. To right and left,
where the curves of the land rose to the sky, the white
foam of orchards half buried rosy farmhouses and their
own dark boughs. The dense thorn hedges gleamed all
wet, compelling the wind to dip deep into them and taste
their fragrance, coolness, moistness, softness all together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
envying not the earnest bee, or the dallying butterfly,
or even the insect that was drowning in a dewy flower.
How the dew washed away the night! I thought that
the old man had spoken truly when he said that the
Golden Age comes again with every dawn. The dew
gave the eyes a kind of fitness and worthiness to behold
the white fruit blossom and the sudden hills of horse-chestnut
green. It washed out London as the old man’s
brush had done. See! the world is but a brown and
fragrant cloud decorated with dark boles, green foliage,
white bloom, and here and there a soul akin to them; it
turns the wilful mind into a garden neat and fine, of red
and white, with green lawns between, which the bee
Fancy sucks at and combines. For a minute only, in
one shadowed wood that faced the departing night, all
the birds sang together stormily and hardly moving from
the sprays on which they slept, with something of night
in their voices. But as I entered the wood, already the
most of them had gone hither and thither, and only on
high twigs one or two blackbirds and thrushes sang, and
hidden wood pigeons cooed. The young hazel boughs
bent at the top with fresh leaves that were so beautiful
and frail that they seemed but just to have been persuaded
to stay and give up a winged life. The low wych elm
twigs had been dipped in leaves. Wild cherry leaves and
flowers mingled like lovers so young that the boy rivals
the girl in tenderness. There was no path, and pushing
through hazel and cornel and thorn, I saw the eyes of
sitting birds gleam with a little anger through the lustrous
green. Presently the stems were less dense; a little river
ran through freshly cut underwood of hazel and ash and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
oak, their wounds still flashing. There pale primroses and
the last celandines ran in sharp gulfs into the heart of
bluebell and orchis and cuckoo-flower, and the orange-tipped
butterfly tripped over them. The mosses on the
ash and hazel roots gleamed darkly gold and green. In
the rivulet itself broad kingcups swayed and their leaves
sank into darkness and rose into light as the ripples
fluctuated. The blackbird, fed on golden hours, sang
carelessly, time after time, the two opening phrases of an
old Highland melody. Close by, in the cool, sombre,
liquid air between the new-leaved boughs of beech sang
a cuckoo, and his notes seemed not to die but to nestle
and grow quiet among the leaves overhead and the flowers
underfoot, and some of them even to find their embalming
in the little round hawthorn clouds that sailed high above
in a deep stream of blue.</p>

<p>Suddenly my mind went back to the high dark cliffs of
Westminster Abbey, the blank doors and windows of
endless streets, the devouring river, the cold gloom before
dawn, and then with a shudder forgot them and saw the
flowers and heard the birds with such a joy as when the
ships from Tarshish, after three blank years, again unloaded
apes and peacocks and ivory, and men upon the
quay looked on; or as, when a man has mined in the
dead desert for many days, he suddenly enters an old tomb,
and making a light, sees before him vases of alabaster,
furniture adorned with gold and blue enamel and the
figures of gods, a chariot of gold, and a silence perfected
through many ages in the company of death and of the
desire of immortality.</p>

<p>How nobly the ploughman and the plough and three
horses, two chestnuts and a white leader, glide over the
broad swelling field in the early morning! Under the
dewy, dark-green woodside they wheel, pause and go out
into the strong light again, and they seem one and glorious,
as if the all-breeding earth had just sent them up out of
her womb&mdash;mighty, splendid and something grim, with
darkness and primitive forces clinging about them, and
the night in the horses’ manes.</p>

<p>The ship, the chariot, the plough, these three are, I
suppose, the most sovereign beautiful things which man
has made in his time, and such that were his race to pass
away from the earth, would bring him most worship
among his successors.</p>

<p>All are without parallel in nature, wrought out of his
own brain by unaided man; and yet, during their life,
worthy by their beauty, their purpose and their motion
to challenge anything made by the gods on the earth or
in the sea; and after their life is done, sublime and full
of awe, so that when we come upon them neglected and
see their fair, heroic curves, the dirge at their downfall
passes inevitably into a pæan to their majesty. And they
are very old. Probably the beasts and the birds, the winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and waves and hills know us as the creatures who make
the ship, the chariot and the plough. These three things,
as they go about their work, must have become universal
symbols, so that when a man comes in sight, the other
inhabitants of the earth say: Here is he who sails in ships
and drives the chariot and guides the plough. And the
greatest of all is the plough. It is without pride and also
without vanity. The ship and the chariot have sometimes
tried to conceal their ancient simplicity, though
they have never done without it. But the plough is the
same&mdash;in shape like a running hound, with tail uplifted
and muzzle bowed to the scent.</p>

<p>Richard the ploughman is worthy of his plough and
team. He moves heavily with long strides over the baked
yellow field, swaying with the violent motion of the plough
as it cuts the stubborn and knotty soil, and yet seeming to
sway out of joy and not necessity. He is a straight, small-featured,
thin-lipped man, red-haired and with blue eyes of
a fierce loneliness almost fanatical. Hour after hour he
crosses and recrosses the field, up to the ridge, whence he
can see miles of hill and wood; down to the woodside
where the rabbits hardly trouble to hide as he appears,
or to the thick hedge with marigolds below and nearly
all day the song of nightingales. The furrow is always
straight; he could plough it so asleep, and sometimes
perhaps he does. The larks sing invisible in the white
May sky. The swallows and woodlarks and willow wrens
and linnets, with their tenderest of all mortal voices, flit
and sing about him. Partridges whirr and twang. A fox
steals along the hedge, a squirrel glows and ripples across
a bay of the field. And for a little time he notices these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
things in a mild complacency. He has even formed a
theory that there is another finch like a chaffinch, but not
such a singer, and he calls it a piefinch. He likes the
bright weather, and his cheerful greeting leaves the passer-by
feeling stupid because he cannot equal it; few sounds
can equal it, except the shout of a cuckoo and the abandoned
clamour of a deep-voiced hound. He never becomes tired;
at noon and evening in the tavern, he drinks standing,
with one hand on the high door latch and the other holding
the tankard, and talking all the time at the rate of
one phrase to a minute, with serious mouth and distant
eyes which must be symbols to help out the words, for
certainly if those words mean no more than they would
in another man’s mouth, they convey little but the apparent
<i>ennui</i> of all those long hours walking to this oak or that
hawthorn spray.</p>

<p>At first sight the ploughman’s task seems to be one
which ought rightly to be set only to some well-balanced
philosopher, who could calmly descend into himself during
the many lonely hours and think of nature and man in
orderly thoughts. To the ordinary man, with his drug-habit
of taking to reverie during any long spell of solitude,
such a task would seem fatal. In fact, it is pretty certain
that many a plain fellow must be turned into a fool by
the immense monotony of similar furrows and the same
view repeated exactly every quarter of an hour. When
he is still a boy, he goes about even in the four hours’
darkness of the winter mornings with always a song
amidst the sleet or the silent frost. At lunch he can look
for nests or nuts or hunt a stoat. When work is over he
looks forward to songs at “The Chequers” with those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of his own age, or to a shamefaced walk with a girl, or to
fishing for tench and eels, or even to a game of cricket.
But when he is married all that is past. He leads his
horses down to the plough, having some simple thought,
a grievance, a recollection, perhaps a hope, running confusedly
in his head, and all day he turns it over, repeating
himself, exaggerating, puzzling over the meaning of
someone’s words, floundering in digressions, fitting new
words to the wood-pigeon’s talk, trying to keep straight
and to make up his mind, justifying himself, condemning
another, cursing him. Now and then he lifts his eyes to
the sky or the wooded hills and his mind catches at an
impression which never becomes a thought, but something
between a picture and a tune in the head, and its half
oblivion is pleasant, when suddenly the plough leaps
forward from his relaxing grasp, he shouts “Ah, Charley!”
to the leader, mutters a little and settles down again to
the grievance or the recollection or the hope, to be
disturbed on lucky days by the hounds, perhaps, but otherwise
to go on and on; and at noon and evening he takes
his horses back to the stable and confronts men with the
same simple ejaculations as before, after the last glass
possibly reviving his lonely thoughts, but ineffectually.
“How Bill does talk!” they say. What wonder that the
rustic moralist marks an infant’s tomb with the <span class="lock">words&mdash;</span></p>

<p>There is little of wisdom in his words except moderation;

all the rest in the hamlet, and of all his tasks&mdash;ploughing,

<span class="smaller">NOT HERE, O APOLLO!</span></h3>
</div>


<p>It was a clay country of small fields that rose and fell
slightly, not in curves, but in stiff lines which ended
abruptly in the low, dividing hedges. Here and there we
passed small woods of oak, hardly more than overgrown
hedges, where keepers shot the jays. There were few
streams&mdash;and those polluted. North and south the land
rose up in some pomp to steep hills planted with oak and
beech and fir, and between these, broad meadows and hop
gardens, which now and then caught the faint light on
their dry brown or moist green and gleamed desirably.
The wind was in the north; it had rained in the night,
and yet the morning was dull and the sun white and
small. There was some vice in the wind or in the foliage
or in the grass that now began to be long&mdash;some vice
that made the land sad and cold and unawakening, with
the surliness of a man who cannot sleep and will not rise.</p>

<p>The woods became more dense as we walked; not far
ahead the oaks closed in and expounded the contours of
the land by their summits. But our path led away from
them, and we were about to lose sight of them when,
gently as the alighting of a bird, the sunlight dropped
among the tops of the oaks, which were yellow and
purple with young leaves, and blessed them. We turned.
There was the sun held fast among the fresh leaves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
green trunks, as if Apollo had changed into a woodland
god, and forsaken the long lonely ways of heaven, and
resolved no more to spend a half of his days in the under
world. How the nymphs clapped their hands at this
advent, abandoning Pan, and bringing to the new lord all
choicest herbs and highest fair grasses and golden flowers
that should make him content to be away from the clouds
of sunset and dawn, and blue flowers on which his feet
should tread without envy of the infinite paths of the sky,
and white flowers that should suffice for his shepherding
in place of the flocks of the high desolate noon! How
they drove up grey dove and green woodpecker to shake
their wings and shine about the new god’s head as they
flew among the branches! How Pan himself, that does
not heed dark hours, crept away from his light-hearted
nymphs and hid in the sombre reeds! “Ever-young
Apollo! Eternal Apollo! Young Apollo!” were the
cries. “Why have we ever served a goat-foot god?”
And so they made haste to serve him with the clearest
honey of the wild bees, the cream from the farm that was
most clean, the fruits that yet preserved flavours of a past
summer and autumn in the granary close by, and fresh
cresses from the spring; nor would some of the little
satyrs forget the golden ale and amber bread and cheese
of the colour of primroses; and all seemed assured that
never again would Apollo forsake the red and yellow
leaves of the full oaks or the mid-forest grasses or the
lilied pools standing among willow and alder and ash.
And we saw that the light was passing in triumph slowly,
and accompanied by the cooing of doves, along the wood
from oak top to oak top.</p>

<span class="smaller">WALKING WITH GOOD COMPANY</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The lightning grows upon the sky like a tumultuous
thorn tree of fire. The thunder grumbles with interrupted
cadences, and then, joyful as a poet, hits the long,
grave, reverberating period at last, repeats it triumphantly,
and muttering dies away. The pheasants in the woods
have got over their alarm and have ceased to crow, and
for a time the heavy perpendicular rain submerges the
meadow and farmhouse and mid-field oak and the steep
downs with their cloudy woods; the birds are still.</p>

<p>Then the rain wastes away. I can count the drops on
the broad burdock leaves; and the evening sun comes
through horizontally; and it is good to be afoot and
making for something remote, I know not why. Each
meadow shines amid its encircling hedges like a lake of
infinitely deep emerald. On the dark red ploughland
the flints glitter with constellated or solitary lights. In the
sweet copses, where the willow wren sings again in
the highest branches, the thorn foliage is so bright that the
dark stems are invisible. The purple oak tops reach
wonderfully into the sombre, bluish sky, and over them
the wood pigeons turn rapidly from darkness to splendour&mdash;from
splendour to darkness, as they wheel and clap their
wings. The cuckoos shout again; first one, so far off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that the character, without the notes, of the song is
recognised; then another with a wild clearness in its
voice as if the rainy air aided it; and then one just overhead,
in the luminous grey branches of an oak, so that it
can be heard trying hard and enjoying its own strength.
The hills rejoice with long shadows and yellow light; the
tall hares stretch themselves and gallop. The little pools
hum pleasantly as the rain drips from their overhanging
brier and bramble into the leaden water with bright
splash. And in our own muscles and hearts the evening
strives to form an aspiration that shall suit the joy of the
hills, the meadows, the copses and their people. We will
go on, they say; we will go on and on, through the
beeches on the hill and up over the ridge and down again
through the grey wet meadows and to the old road
between hawthorn and guelder-rose at the foot of the
downs; and still on, not as before, but out of time and
space, until we come&mdash;home&mdash;to some refuge of beauty
and serenity in the heart of the immense evening. And
so we will, though we shall be wise to find our achievement
in the rapture of walking, or in the short rest upon
a gate where we may surprise the twilight at her consecrating
task. It is well, too, to talk, not to walk
silently and weave such dreams as will make our host
to-night intolerable; or if not to talk, then to sing some
old song whose melody finds a strange fitness to our minds,
in spite of the words, as for <span class="lock">example&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Then perhaps we will lazily inquire why songs about
the price of malt, or the coming of a Beautiful Ass out of
the East should stir and uplift and compose the hearts of
men dreaming of an ideal beauty on an April evening,
and so to more songs and then to bed, finding at the last
moment the serene and beautiful, perhaps, in the glimpse
of holy evening landscape rich in unseen nightingales as
we fall asleep.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smaller">NO MAN’S GARDEN</span></h3>
</div>


<p>For a mile, alongside a bright high-road, runs a twelve-foot
strip of grass and clover and buttercups, with cinquefoil’s
golden embroidery in the turf at the edge. Little
circular heaps of silver wood ash mark the cold fires of
tramps, here and there. Here also they sleep in the sun,
in summer and autumn, and in winter lean in the dense
hedge that keeps the north wind away. The hedge is
rich and high, of thorn overgrown by traveller’s joy and
bryony; and at its feet, stitchwort, campions, vetchlings
and bird’s-foot trefoil grow luxuriantly.</p>

<p>This is no man’s garden. Every one who is nobody
sits there with a special satisfaction, watching the swift,
addle-faced motorist, the horseman, the farmer, the tradesman,
the publican, go by; for here he is secure as in the
grave, and even as there free&mdash;if he can&mdash;to laugh or
scoff or wonder or weep at the world.</p>

<p>As I was trying to persuade some buoyant bryony
strands with snaky heads to return to the hedge from
which they had wandered into danger, a tramp came up.</p>

<p>“Have you seen my old woman?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not know her? She is the cursedest, foulest-mouthed
old woman in the country, fond of too much drink, and
she has just been spending the winter in prison&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
prefers it to the workhouse which I have just left. But
she just suits me. There is no one like her. They often
tell me to take another instead of her, but I never will....</p>

<p>“I don’t know that you would like to see her. She is
not a beauty, and she is not dressed up well. She is as
crooked as an oak branch, and she has one leg longer than
the other, and as to her face I could make a better one
myself with a handful of dirt. She drags as she walks,
what with keeping up with me all these years. You may
know her, because she is always smoking. She cannot
eat; she lives on tobacco and beer....</p>

<p>“Oh, I see you are one of these antiquarian gents. If
you would really like to see her....</p>

<p>“Well, if you are curious, how would you like to hear
of the murder I did twenty years ago? I tell it to everybody,
and they don’t seem to believe me, so I will tell it
to you....</p>

<p>“I spent a night in the workhouse and when I got out
in the afternoon I was so hungry that I could have eaten
the master, if he hadn’t been the ugliest fellow I ever saw,
like a fancy potato. Walking didn’t cure my appetite,
and all that day and night I didn’t have a bite. Perhaps
I got a bit queer and I went on walking until I got near
to Binoll in Wiltshire where I was born. That is a fine
country. My old woman and I have slept in violets there
many a time in April. When I got there early in the
morning on the second day I thought I would go into a
copse I knew and pick some bluebells there, partly for old
remembrance sake and partly to make a penny or two in
Swindon, but I didn’t much care what. Well, as I was
picking them&mdash;God! how everything did smell and I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
like a little boy, I was enjoying it so, and putting my
hand into all the nests and feeling the warm eggs&mdash;Lord!
what a fool I be&mdash;I thought I would go to sleep. There
was such a nice bit of moon in the sky, with the rim of
the cup of it uppermost, which means that it keeps the
rain from falling, but if it is upside down it lets the water
out and you may know it will rain. There was a regular
old-fashioned English thrush saying: ‘Bit, bit, slingdirt,
slingdirt, belcher, belcher, belcher,’ and I went on picking
the flowers. All of a sudden I saw two fellows sitting
just outside the wood with their backs to me. One of
them was a big fellow and we passed the time of day and
he said he had done a job lately and was not in a hurry to
do any more. The other was a little white-faced man
such as I can’t away with, and he said he was looking for
a job and trying to get his strength up a bit. The big
fellow motioned to me, meaning that the other had got
money about him; so I agreed, and nodded, and he
stepped back and hit the little fellow a good blow on the
head. I threw away the flowers and we dragged him
into the wood. He had ten shillings on him and we took
half each. He looked very bad, so the other fellow said:
‘We had better put him away,’ and I said; ‘Yes, he may
be in awful pain, such a white-faced fellow as he is.’ So
we knocked the life out of him, and the other fellow went
off Marlborough way and I went into Swindon and
had such a dinner as I hadn’t had for weeks, rabbit and
new potatoes and a bit of curry.... Did you ever hear
about that?</p>

<p>“Get on my mind? Why, I never meant the fellow
any harm and I filled my belly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you tell me where there is a lone road where I
can make a bit of fire? I don’t like the dust and noise of
these motor cars.” ...</p>

<p>Away he went, halting a little, and yet, from behind,
having an absurd resemblance to a child, which his cheerfulness
reinforced.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, I found him just awakened from
his first sleep, near a dead fire that had been no bigger
than a pigeon’s nest.</p>

<p>“What a country this is,” he said indignantly, but
with good humour.</p>

<p>“There are not enough sticks in this wood to warm
the only man who wants them. I suppose they use
all the firing to keep the pheasants warm. Hark at
them! If I was a rich man I wouldn’t keep such
birds....</p>

<p>“England is not such a place as it was when I was a
young man. It is not half the size for one thing. Why,
when I was a young man, you could go up a lane with a
long dog or two and pick up a bit of supper and firing
and nothing said. The country seemed to belong to me
in those days, but now I might as well be in Africa. I
am worse off than the labourers now, except that I have
got more sense than they have, singing their silly old
songs, like this.” Then he sang with perhaps mock
sentimentality a frail little peasant song, full of the
smallness of lonely, small <span class="lock">lives:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“What is that to the song about ‘the swift and silly

now for toe-rags like me and you; if you wanted to, you
couldn’t sleep on Bearsted Green to-night.”</p>

<p>Later in the year, on August Bank holiday, I found him
at an inn, where a farm bailiff was treating the labourers to
much ale. The landlord had a young relative down from
London, who sang a song in the bar about a skylark who
was to take a message to his mother in heaven. At this
the tramp melted a little: the pale face of the singer and
the high shrill voice made an entrance somewhere, and
he tried to join in the song. But towards evening he
was to be found sticking pins through his cheek and ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and into his arms, and offering, for a small sum, to stick
them into any part whatsoever; or, lying on his back
and twisting his head back&mdash;the muscles in his throat
croaking all the time like frogs&mdash;to pick up with his teeth
a penny that lay on the floor. The bailiff had caught
him. He did odd jobs about the farm, and lived in a
forgotten cottage, too far away from anywhere to keep
pigs in. But he slept in the cottage only on one or
two nights in the seven. During the rest of the week
he was to be found at night under the edge of a copse,
beside a little fire, reminding himself of the old, roomy
England which he used to know.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="smaller">MARCH DOUBTS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>All day the winter seemed to have gone. The horses’
hoofs on the moist, firm road made a clear “cuck-oo” as
they rose and fell; and far off, for the first time in the
year, a ploughboy, who remembered spring and knew that
it would come again, shouted “Cuckoo! cuckoo!”</p>

<p>A warm wind swept over the humid pastures and red
sand-pits on the hills and they gleamed in a lightly
muffled sun. Once more in the valleys the ruddy farmhouses
and farm-buildings seemed new and fair again, and
the oast-house cones stood up as prophets of spring, since
the south wind had turned all their white vanes towards
the north, and they felt the sea that lay&mdash;an easy journey
on such a day&mdash;beyond the third or fourth wooded ridge
in the south. The leaves of goose-grass, mustard, vetch,
dog’s mercury, were high above the dead leaves on hedge
banks. Primrose and periwinkle were blossoming. Like
flowers were the low ash-tree boles where the axe had but
lately cut off the tall rods; flowerlike and sweet also the
scent from the pits where labourers dipped the freshly
peeled ash poles in tar. In the elms, sitting crosswise on
a bough, sang thrush and missel thrush; in the young
corn, the larks; the robins in the thorns; and in all the
meadows the guttural notes of the rooks were mellowed
by love and the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Making deep brown ruts across the empty green fields
came the long waggons piled high with faggots; the
wheels rumbled; the harness jingled and shone; the
horses panted and the carters cracked their whips.</p>

<p>Soon would the first chiff-chaff sing in the young
larches; at evening the calm, white, majestic young
clouds should lie along the horizon in a clear and holy air;
and climbing a steep hill at that hour, the walker should
see a window, as it were, thrown open in the sky and
hear a music that should silence thought and even regret&mdash;as
when, on the stage, a window is opened and some one
invisible is heard to sing a heavy-laden song below it.</p>

<p>But as I walked and the wind fell for the sunset, the
path led me under high, stony beeches. The air was
cool and still and moist and waterish dark, and no bird
sang. A wood-pigeon spread out his barry tale as he
ascended perpendicularly to a hidden place among the
branches, and then there was no sound. The waterish
half-light seemed to have lasted for ever and to have an
eternity ahead. Through the trees a grassy, deeply rutted
road wound downwards, and at the edge the ruts were
broad and full of dark water. Still retaining some corruption
of the light of the sky upon its surface, that shadowed
water gave an immense melancholy to the wood. The
reflections of the beeches across it were as the bars of a
cage that imprisoned some child of light. It was but a
few inches deep of rain, and yet, had it been a legendary
pool, or had a drowned woman’s hair been stamped into
the mud at its edge and left a green forehead exposed, it
could not have stained and filled the air more tragically.
The cold, the silence, the leaflessness found an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in that clouded shining surface among the ruts. Life
and death seemed to contend there, and I recalled a dream
which I had lately dreamed.</p>

<p>I dreamed that someone had cut the cables that anchored
me to such tranquillity as had been mine, and that I was
drifted out upon an immensity of desolation and solitude.
I was without hope, without even the energy of despair
that might in time have given birth to hope. But in that
desolation I found one business: to search for a poison
that should kill slowly, painlessly and unexpectedly. In
that search I lost sight of what had persuaded me to it;
yet when at last I succeeded, I took a draught and went
out into the road and began to walk. A calm fell upon
me such as I had sometimes found in June thunderstorms
on lonely hills, or in midnights when I stepped for a
moment after long foolish labours to my door, and heard
the nightingales singing out from the Pleiades that overhung
the wood, and saw the flower-faced owl sitting on
the gate. I walked on, not hastening with a too great
desire nor lingering with a too careful quietude. It was
as yet early morning, and the wheat sheaves stood on the
gentle hills like yellow-haired women kneeling to the sun
that was about to rise. Now and then I passed the
corners of villages, and sometimes at windows and
through doorways, I saw the faces of men and women I
had known and seemed to forget, and they smiled and
were glad, but not more glad than I. Labouring in the
fields also were men whose faces I was happy to recognise
and see smiling with recognition. And very sweet it was
to go on thus, at ease, knowing neither trouble nor fatigue.
I could have gone on, it seemed, for ever, and I wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
live so for ever, when suddenly I remembered the poison.
Then of each one I met I begged a remedy. Some
reminded me that formerly I had made a poor thing of
life, and said that it was too late. Others supposed that I
jested. A few asked me to stay with them and rest.
The sky and the earth, and the men and women drank of
the poison that I had drunken, so that I could not endure
the use of my eyes, and I entered a shop to buy some
desperate remedy that should end all at once, when, seeing
behind the counter a long-dead friend in wedding attire,
I awoke.</p>

<p>Even so in the long wet ruts did the false hope of spring
contend with the shadows: even so at last did it end,
when the dead leaves upon the trees begin to stir madly
in the night wind, with the sudden, ghastly motion of
burnt paper on a still fire when a draught stirs it in a
silent room at night; and even the nearest trees seemed
to be but fantastic hollows in the misty air.</p>

<span class="smaller">A DECORATED CHURCH</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Out of the midst of pale wheat lands and tussocky
meadow, intersected by streams which butter bur and
marigold announce, and soared over by pewit and lark
and the first swallows with their delicate laughter, rises
the grim, decorated church, of the same colour as the
oak trees round about. White and grey headstones, some
of great age, bow to it in the churchyard, and seem
mutely to crave for the shelter from the north-east wind.
There is much room within. All the headstones and
those whom they commemorate might find places and
not crowd out the little congregation. In one transept a
knight and lady are taking their ease in stone, and looking
up at the gaudy arms above them. They came early to
the church. From the memorial inscriptions on pavement
and walls, it would seem that the church belongs
to a later great family, still living near. Soldiers, sailors,
landowners, clergymen even, they take possession at their
death; from 1623 they have flocked here, and the names
of their virtues live after them; tyrants perhaps in their
lifetime, they have the air of being idols now, and they
outnumber the prophets on the window-glass. The
service proceeds in the accustomed decent manner, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
nasal lesson and humming prayer. Then comes the
<span class="lock">hymn:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Through all the changing scenes of life”&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>One woman’s ambitious, shrill treble voice that seems
ever about to fall and yet continues to maintain its airy
height, leads the congregation to unusual adventures of
song. The church is dense with emotion; ordinary
gentlemen, shopkeepers, labourers and their wives, men
and women of all degrees of endurance, chivalry, good
intention, uncertain aims, sentimental virtuousness,
hypocrisy not dissevered from hardship, vanity not ignorant
of tenderness, hard ambition, the desire to be
respected,&mdash;men and women throw all kinds of strange
meaning, heartfelt and present, imaginative, retrospective,
expectant, into the vague words of the hymn. I can see
one strong man shouting it with an expression as if he
were pole-axing a bull. His neighbour, a frail, tearful
woman, sings as if it absolves her from the tears with
which she marred not only her own life. One aged
woman made it clearly an expression of the nothingness
of mankind, a ridicule and blasphemy of life, as if she
had repeated the words of the old <span class="lock">play:&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Other faces express complacency, hope, the newness of a
solution of this thing life, grim, satisfied despair, even a
kind of vanity. All these men and women might agree
at a political meeting; here they differ each from the
rest, and every one of the gods in all the mythologies
must be gladdened or angered at some part of the hymn
by the meaning of this or that worshipper; Odin,
Apollo, Diana, Astarte, the Cat, the Beetle, and the rest
revive, in whatever Tartarus they are thrust, at these
strange sounds.</p>

<p>The last of the congregation left, but I could still hear
the hymn wandering feebly among the tall arches and up
and about, apparently restless, as if it sought to get out
and away, but in vain. The high grey stone and those
delicate windows made a cage; and the human voices
were as those of Seifelmolouk and his memlooks, when
the giant king kept them in cages because the sound of
their lamentation seemed to him the most melodious
music, and he thought them birds. Inexorably, the fancy
held me that some gaunt giant, fifty cubits high, kept
men and women in this cage because he loved to hear
their voices expressing moods he knew nothing of. Not
more caged are the five brown bells in the tower, with
mute, patient heads like cows, their names being Solitude,
Tranquillity, Duty, Harmony, Joy.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smaller">GARLAND DAY</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The sun had not risen though it had long been
proclaimed, when the old road led us into a moist wood
that grew on the hillside, and here and there overhung a
perpendicular chalk cliff. The soil was black and crisp
with old beech mast, and out of it grew the clear, grave,
green leaves of anemone and dog’s mercury and spurge
and hyacinth and primroses, in places so dense that the
dim earth below them seemed to be some deep lake’s
water. All the anemones were bowed and rosy. The
blue bells were plated with rain. The dark spurge leaves
were crowned by pale green flowers. The primroses
grew, twenty in a cluster, on long flushed stalks; each
petal was perfect, and down their leaves the raindrops
slid and glittered or gleamed duskily. Arching above
these, the low brier branches carried sharp green young
foliage. A shadowed pool in one of the hollows was
hardly to be distinguished from the dark earth, except
that it was covered with white crowfoot flowers as with
five minutes’ snow.</p>

<p>From among the flowers ascended straight stony rods
of ash, their ancient stoles bossy and hollowed like skulls,
and covered with moss; and from the purple encrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
ash-flowers wood-pigeons shook the rain down to the
leaves beneath. Amongst the ash trees were hazels, new
leaved, their olive stems gloomily shining.</p>

<p>Over all, the ancient beeches stood up with hard
sculptured holes supporting storey after storey of branch
and shade which were traversed at the top and at the
fringes by fair fresh leaves. The rain had run down the
main trunks for generations, and made paths of green
and black that tried to gleam. Here and there, low
down, the beeches extended long priestly branches clothed
in leaf, still and curved, to call for silence in the cool,
shadowy, crystal air.</p>

<p>Far away among the branches whitened the chalk
cliffs. On this side and on that, immense mossy
boulders made tables for thrushes and cast perfect
shadows.</p>

<p>High up in the beeches, the invisible wood-wrens sang,
and their songs were as if, overhead in the stainless air,
little waves of pearls dropped and scattered and shivered
on a shore of pearls. Below them the wood-pigeons
began to coo&mdash;with notes that were but as rounded
bubbles emerging from the silence and lost again. Just
within hearing, in the hawthorn hedge of the wood,
blackbirds were singing: they opened with the most
high, arrogating notes that slowly rolled on to noble
ends, when suddenly they laughed and ceased; again and
again they began so, and again and again they laughed,
as if they had grown too wise to believe utterly in noble
things. As we went deeper into the wood they ceased,
and those moist shades welcomed us as if they held what
we desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The trees were very old; their leaves were fresh and
wet as when beauty and joy shed a few tears. The soil
was centuries deep in black beech mast; the herbage
seemed to have been born from it in that very hour.
The boulders had stood among the primroses so long that
the thrushes had chiselled shallow cups in them as they
fed there in the mornings; they were embossed with the
most tender green and golden moss. The shadows were
as solemn and imperturbable as to a child a cathedral,
when he first steps into its solitude alone, and a god is
created anew out of his marvelling; and yet the hems
of their mantles, where they swept the ground, disclosed
a flashing underside of crystals newly-born. And for
ourselves&mdash;we seemed to be home from a long exile,
and the pains of it, such as they were, turned like the
shadows into crystal. Here, then, was the land to which
had fled those children who once bore our names, who
were our companions in the days when sunshine was
more than wine had ever been since, and they left us
long ago, not suddenly, but so strangely, that we knew
not that they were far off; hither those children had
fled, and their companions of that time; here they had
been hiding these many years; abiding here they had
become immortal in the green-fledged antique wood, and
we had come back to them. Perhaps they recognised
us: perhaps they re-entered these bodies of ours. For
once more the cuckoo was clear, golden, joyous. When
we heard the blackbird again we did not quarrel with the
laugh at his own solemnity, since it was not there. It
was not memory, nor hope. Memory perished, and hope
that never rests lay asleep; and winds blew softly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
over Lethe and breathed upon our eyelids, coming as
delicate intercessors between us and life. We forgot that
ours had been the sin of Alcyone and Ceyx who, in their
proud happiness, called one another <em>Zeus!</em> and <em>Here!</em>
and for that were cast down by the gods. Once again
we did so, for this was the wood of youth, and in the
old streets of the soul where the grass grows among the
long-untrodden stones, and in the doorways of deserted
homes, the sound of footsteps and the click of a frequented
latch was heard.</p>

<p>And yonder is the wide prospect again, and the dawn,&mdash;the
green hedges starred with white stitchwort flower,
misty with the first hawthorn clusters, a-flutter with
whitethroat, wild with the warbling of the blackcap in
their depths; wide, lustrous meadows dimmed by cuckoo
flowers, and at the edges of them the oaks beginning to
bud and their branches like great black brands about to
break into golden flame; and about the oaks that stood
in the midst of them the grass waving in the sun like
brooks plunging from their roots; farmhouses known
only by their encircling apple trees all in bloom; radiant
pools where the sand-piper laughed; woods where the
oak and ash waded deep in the translucent green of the
undergrowth’s rising tide and even then glowed with
brown and unborn greens, and the nightingale sang far
withdrawn, and at the edge the hurdle-maker worked by
his thatched cote; and ridge beyond ridge of hills cloudily
wooded; and over all the low sky like a blue bowl just
emptied of its cream.</p>

<p>And as we sat at breakfast the village children came
up the path between borders dense with tall yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
leopard’s bane and red honesty and sang by the
<span class="lock">windows&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>And they carried garlands of ivy entwined among bluebells
and cowslips from the moist warm copses and the
meadows.</p>

<p>On the twin vanes of the oasts, one pointing east, one
north, the south wind and the west wind were asleep in
one another’s arms.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="smaller">AN OLD WOOD</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The chestnut blossom is raining steadily and noiselessly
down upon a path whose naked pebbles receive mosaic of
emerald light from the interlacing boughs. At intervals,
once or twice an hour, the wings of a lonely swallow pass
that way, when alone the shower stirs from its perpendicular
fall. Cool and moist, the perfumed air flows,
without lifting the most nervous leaf or letting fall a suspended
bead of the night’s rain from a honeysuckle bud.
In an indefinite sky of grey, through which one ponderous
cloud billows into sight and is lost again, no sun
shines: yet there is light&mdash;I know not whence; for the
brass trappings of the horses beam so as to be extinguished
in their own fire. There is no song in wood or sky.
Some one of summer’s wandering voices&mdash;bullfinch or
willow-wren&mdash;might be singing, but unheard, at least unrealised.
From the dead nettle spires, with dull green leaves
stained by purple and becoming more and more purple
towards the crest, which is of a sombre uniform purple,
to the elms reposing at the horizon, all things have bowed
the head, hushed, settled into a perfect sleep. Those
elms are just visible, no more. The path has no sooner
emerged from one shade than another succeeds, and so,
on and on, the eye wins no broad dominion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a land that uses a soft compulsion upon the passer-by,
a compulsion to meditation, which is necessary before
he is attached to a scene rather featureless, to a land that
hence owes much of its power to a mood of generous
reverie which it bestows. And yet it is a land that gives
much. Companionable it is, reassuring to the solitary;
he soon has a feeling of ease and seclusion there. The
cool-leaved wood! The limitless, unoccupied fields of
marsh marigold, seen through the trees, most beautiful
when the evening rain falls slowly, dimming and almost
putting out the lustrous bloom! Gold of the minute
willows underfoot! Leagues of lonely grass where the
slow herds tread the daisies and spare them yet!</p>

<p>Towards night, under the sweet rain, at this warm,
skyless close of the day, the trees, far off in an indolent,
rolling landscape, stand as if disengaged from the world,
in a reticent and pensive repose.</p>

<p>But suddenly the rain has ceased. In an old, dense
wood the last horizontal beams of the sun embrace the
trunks of the trees and they glow red under their moist
ceiling of green. A stile to be crossed at its edge, where
a little stream, unseen, sways the stiff exuberant angelica
that grows from it, gives the word to pause, and with a
rush the silence and the solitude fill the brain. The
wood is of uncounted age; the ground on which it
stands is more ancient than the surrounding fields, for it
rises and falls stormily, with huge boulders here and
there; not a path intrudes upon it; the undergrowth is
impenetrable to all but fox and bird and this cool red
light about the trunks of the trees. Far away a gate is
loudly shut, and the rich blue evening comes on and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
severs me irrevocably from all but the light in the old
wood and the ghostly white cow-parsley flowers suspended
on unseen stalks. And there, among the trees
and their shadows, not understood, speaking a forgotten
tongue, old dreads and formless awes and fascinations
discover themselves and address the comfortable soul,
troubling it, recalling to it unremembered years not so
long past but that in the end it settles down into a
gloomy tranquillity and satisfied discontent, as when we
see the place where we were unhappy as children once.
Druid and devilish deity and lean wild beast, harmless
now, are revolving many memories with me under the
strange, sudden red light in the old wood, and not more
remote is the league-deep emerald sea-cave from the
storm above than I am from the world.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="smaller">IN A FARMYARD</span></h3>
</div>


<p>We waited to let the forty cows go past, each of them
pausing to lick the forehead of the strawberry cow that
leaned over the gate of her stall and lowed continually
concerning her newly-born white calf. But so slow
they were in their wanton, obedient movement to the
milking-shed that we turned and found another path,
and thus surprised a pond lying deep among tansy
flowers, grey nettles and billows of conquering bramble
and brier.</p>

<p>The farmyard was always dusty, or deep with ridgy
mire, from the trampling of men and horses and cows in
the streets that wound among its cart-lodges, stables,
stalls, milking-sheds and barns all glowing with mature
tiles, and ricks gleaming with amber thatch. But in a
corner lay unused, older than them all, the long-headed
and snaky-bodied pond. We learned to know that pond.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when summer has honoured the water with
a perfect suit of emerald green, that pond shows itself to
be a monstrous, coiled, primæval thing, lying undisturbed,
and content to be still and contemplative. Often
has the monster been driven away&mdash;by draining; often
has it returned, still a green, coiled, primæval being that
disappears suddenly in November and leaves a soft, dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
pool. Some have ventured to intrude upon the monster,
to fish for the sleepy carp which are found when it has
been driven from its nest of purple mud; but they fish in
vain.</p>

<p>The solitary, dying ash tree at the edge of the pond
seems, by day, when the monster is powerful there in the
summer, to be but the skeleton of an old victim; or, in
the winter, the sad and twisted nymph of the water.
But every night, like any dreaming child or musing
lover, though not perhaps so happily, is it let into a
varied, strange, exalted paradise.</p>

<p>You may see it&mdash;on still evenings when the mist prevails
over all things except the robin’s song, and makes
even that more melancholy&mdash;or when the songs of many
nightingales besiege, enter and possess the house and the
deserted farmyard&mdash;or when the cold and entirely silent
air under a purple November sky chills the blood, so that
friendship and hope and purposes are all in vain as in an
opiate dream&mdash;then you may see the ash-tree take heart.
It has the air of one going home upon a lonely road that
will not end in loneliness. Those bare and stiff, decaying
branches are digits pointing homeward through the
sky; the tree forgets the monster at its feet and the
children who laugh and the supremacy of the buildings
round about. It might seem, with those extended
branches, to be a self-torturing and aspiring fanatic who
had endured thus for uncounted days and nights, and has
his vision at last. For, when night is perfect, the tree
exults, and though it is perhaps not joyous, it is as one of
those great sorrowful temperaments&mdash;of soldier, or explorer,
or humorist&mdash;so active and inexorable that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
may claim kinship with the truly joyous ones. If it is
still sad, it is “endiademed with woe.” How large and
satanic it is beside the heavy rounded oaks and the
stately, feminine elms and the lovely limes.</p>

<p>Even so might a philosopher heighten and lord it,
travelling in Charon’s ship along with deflated tyrants and
rhetoricians and bold and crimson animals born to eat
provinces and to poison worms; even so, Ossian and
Arthur and Cuchullain and Achilles triumph over men
that were yesterday on thrones and chariots.</p>

<p>Often have I seen the tree, and it alone, giving character
to the whole valley and filling the land as a bell
fills a cathedral or as the droning of a bee fills a lily.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent12">“With him enthroned</div>
       <div class="verse">Sat sable-vested night, eldest of things,</div>
       <div class="verse">The consort of his reign.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>My little thoughts seem to be drawn up among the
black branches like twittering birds going to rest in some
high cliff that is a chief pillar of the fabric of the night.
Half dead and threatened though it be, surely the spirit of
it, which is to many a broad and tragical night as the arm
of a great painter to his picture, will survive not only me
and my words but the tree itself. I have approached it
on some moonlit midnights, when the sky was so deep
that the tall oaks were as weeds at the bottom of an
unfathomed sea, and it has stood up erect and puissant,
as if it were the dreamer at one with all he sees, in a
world of blind men with open eyes. Then, as the
autumn dawn arrived it was still looking towards Orion;
defrauded, indeed for a time of its vision, but not of its
glory. The swaying cows wandered to the milking-sheds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The little bats ran to and fro in the air and
made their little snipping and drumming sounds. It was
light; but the ash tree was not utterly cast down; it
still walked in the way of the stars; it was inscribed in
solemn characters upon the sun that rode up red in the
mist.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="smaller">MEADOWLAND</span></h3>
</div>


<p>This is one of the tracts of country which are discovered
by few except such as study the railway maps of England
in order to know what to avoid. On those maps it is
one of several large triangular sections which railways
bound, but have not entered. All day long the engines
scream along their boundaries, and at night wave fiery
arms to the sky, as if to defend a forbidden place or a
sanctuary. Within there is peace, and a long ancient
lane explores it, with many windings and turnings back,
as if it were a humble, diffident inquirer, fortunately
creeping on, aiming at some kind of truth and not
success, yet without knowing what truth is when he
starts. Here it hesitates by a little pool, haunted, as is
clear from the scribbled footprints on the shore, only by
moorhen and wagtail, and, in the spindle trees beside it,
by a witty thrush; there it goes joyously forward, straight
among lines of tall oaks and compact thorns; then it
turns to climb a hill from which all the country it has
passed is visible first, meadow and withy copse and stream,
and next the country which it has yet to pass&mdash;a simple
dairy land with green grass, green woods, and stout grey
haystacks round the pale farms. But in a little while it
winds, confused again under high maple and dogwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hedges, downhill, as if it had already forgotten what the
hilltop showed. On the level again the hollow wood
which the willow wren fills with his little lonely song has
to be penetrated; the farmyard must be passed through,
and the spirit of the road looks in at the dairy window
and sees the white discs of cream in the pans and the
cool-armed maid lifting a cheese; and yet another farmyard
it loiters in, watching the roses and plume-poppy
and lupin of the front garden, going between the stables
and the barn, and there spreading out as if it had resolved
to cease and always watch the idle waggon, the fair-curved
hay-rakes leaning against the wall, and the fowls
which are the embodiment of senseless reverie&mdash;when lo!
the path goes straight across wide and level pastures, with a
stream at its side. Seen afar off, losing itself among the
elms that watch over the hill-side church, the little white
road is as some quiet, hermit saint, just returned from
long seclusion, and about to take up his home for ever
and ever in the chancel; but when we reach the place,
he is still as far away, still uncertain in the midst of the
corn below. At the charlock-yellow summit the road
seems to lead into the sky, where the white ladders are
let down from the sun.</p>

<p>The ways of such a road&mdash;when the June grass is high
and in the sun it is invisible except for its blueness and
its buttercups, and the chaffinch, the corn-bunting and
yellowhammer, the sleepiest voiced birds, are most persistent&mdash;easily
persuade the mind that it alone is travelling,
travelling through an ideal country, belonging to itself
and beyond the power of the world to destroy. The
few people whom we see, the mower, the man hoeing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
onion-bed in a spare half-hour at mid-day, the children
playing “Jar-jar-winkle” against a wall, the women
hanging out clothes,&mdash;these the very loneliness of the
road has prepared us for turning into creatures of dream;
it costs an effort to pass the time of day with them,

<p>Yonder the road curves languidly between hedges and
broad fringes of green, and along it an old man guides
the cattle in to afternoon milking. They linger to crop
the wayside grass and he waits, but suddenly resumes his
walk and they obey, now hastening with tight udders
and looking from side to side. They turn under the archway
of a ruined abbey, and low as if they enjoy the reverberation,
and disappear. I never see them again; but
the ease, the remoteness, the colour of the red cattle in
the green road, the slowness of the old cowman, the
timelessness of that gradual movement under the fourteenth
century arch, never vanish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Of such things the day is made, not of milestones and
antiquities. Isolated, rapt from the earth, perhaps, by
the very fatigue which at the end restores us to it
forcibly, the mind goes on seeing and remembering these
things.</p>

<p>Here the cattle stand at the edge of a pond and the
tench swim slowly above the weeds amongst them as
they stand. The sun strikes down upon the glassy water,
but cannot take away the coolness of the reeds about the
margin. Under the one oak in the meadow above, the
farmer sits with his dog, so still that the dabchick does
not dive and the water vole nibbles the reed, making a
small sound, the only one.</p>

<p>There five little girls play the lovers’ game on a green
in front of their cottages. One of them kneels down
and cries quietly; the others hold hands and circle round
her, <span class="lock">singing&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Poor Mary sits a-weeping, a-weeping, a-weeping,</div>
       <div class="verse">Poor Mary sits a-weeping, by the bright shining shore.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Oh tell us what you’re weeping for, weeping for, weeping for,</div>
       <div class="verse">Oh tell us what you’re weeping for, by the bright shining shore.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then the little “poor Mary,” with her face still in her
apron, takes up the singing, the others still moving round
<span class="lock">her:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“I’m weeping for my true love, my true love, my true love,</div>
       <div class="verse">I’m weeping for my true love, by the bright shining shore.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then the others sing to <span class="lock">her&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Get up and choose a better one, a better one, a better one,</div>
       <div class="verse">Get up and choose a better one, by the bright shining shore.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>At this, Mary rises, and chooses one of those from the
ring, and the two stand in the middle, holding each
other’s hands crossed, while the others <span class="lock">sing&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Your true love is a shepherd’s cross, a shepherd’s cross, a shepherd’s cross,</div>
       <div class="verse">Your true love is a shepherd’s cross, by the bright shining shore.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So Mary now takes her place in the ring; her true love
becomes “poor Mary,” and chooses another lover amidst
the same song; and at last, when all have been Marys
and true lovers, with resolute faces, they scatter carelessly
and forget. Finding some marbles in a roadside crevice,
I ask one child to play, but she says that marbles are not
played after Good Friday. A white cow rests beside, so
much in love with peace that it grazes lying down. On
the other side of the road the bacon hisses and smells
from a farmhouse whose mountainous thatch makes a
cool cave of tranquillity; on the sunny slopes the
starlings who have honeycombed the thatch, whistle or
creep in with food or straw. Not one path disturbs the
unfrequented verdure of the green, though the road winds
lazily round it.</p>

<p>Yonder, up a steep field, goes a boy birdnesting in a
double hedge, stooping to the nettles for the white-throat’s
eggs, straining high among the hawthorns for a dove’s.
He does not hasten. Now and then he calls “cuckoo,”
not a timorous note, but lusty like the bird’s own: and
now he lies down to suck a thrush’s egg. He will not
take the robin’s eggs, “or I shall get my arm broken,”
he says. A cruel game, but so long as he loves it with
all his heart perhaps it is forgiven him, and in a few
years he will never again go slowly up that field, forgetful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of schoolmaster, father and mother and the greatness of
man.</p>

<p>At noon there is a hamlet in front. On one side of it
the church thrusts a golden weathercock high into the
blue sky, and with his proud and jolly head uplifted
towards the north the bird flames and exults; on the
other side, tall beeches give out the sleepy noise of rooks.
Straight ahead “The White Hart,” a white inn with
heavy, overhanging thatch, divides the road in two.
Those white walls can never cease to glow; they have
persuaded the sun to sleep under those eaves for ever like
the carter on the bench. The sign-board hangs silent,
but the sign has melted away. A waggon stands by the
door; the waggoner holds a chestnut mare with one
hand, with the other he slowly tilts the glittering tankard
and shows all of his brown throat throbbing; the hostess
watches.</p>

<p>The low white kitchen is cut in two by a tall, semi-circular
settle, to which the hostess returns, and with a
round elm table between her and the fire she lops fine
greens into a pail. A tenanted fireplace is better than a
cold one on any day of the year, and it is cool in the
window seat between the ale and the wind. Outside
lies the little road, waiting for me. And now we go on
together, the road having still the advantage of me,
though it has poured no libation.</p>

<p>All through the long afternoon that land offers symbols
of peace, security and everlastingness. Tall hedges half
hidden in a rising tide of long, starry herbage, ponds
where the probing carp make the lily leaves rise and flap,
wide meadows where the cows wander half a mile an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
hour, vast green cumulus clouds with round summits here
and there disclosing infinite receding glooms of blue&mdash;these
with their continual presence store the mind, giving
it not only the poignant joy in which half consciously we
know that never again shall we be just here and thus, but
the joy, too, of knowing that we take these things along
with us to the <span class="lock">end&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div></div>

<p>On that poem of Crashaw’s to his ivory-handed mistress
runs my thought as the road, towards evening, once
more progresses without any hedges between it and the
fields, when a broad double hedge or narrow copse of oak
and ash, departs at a right angle from the way. Up to
the briers and thorns at the hem of the trees comes the
close, cool yellow grass and obtains a shadow there. Out
on to that grass the blackbirds have strayed and are straying
farther and farther; the rabbits, too, are well away
from shelter, hopping a few steps and crouching. In the
hedge itself a hedge-sparrow just once lets loose its frail
dewy song, a nightingale utters one phrase of marvelling
and is still. The musky wild roses star all the hedge and
the scent begins to wander in the moist air with the scent
of honeysuckle and of shadowy grasses. Under a now
misted sky that makes the light seem to dwell no longer
in it but in the grass, the flat, yellow field running to the
little wood is a place impregnable and inaccessible. Invisible
walls shut me off, though no hedge intervenes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
no dreadful barrier could do it more effectually. It would
be as easy to step into the past as into this candid field, a
withdrawn world with its own sun.</p>

<p>A mile farther a little town stands upon the edge of
this enclosed land. A brook runs down to its edge and
half encircles it. Clean and fair, shining with linen, the
meadows come right up to the town which turns its back
upon them, with long rows of beans and peas dividing
the yellow houses from one another. The chimney
smoke rises above the criss-cross roofs of stone and thatch
and then travels round the church tower, which emerges
from the houses like some grave schoolmaster out of his
children, most of them thronging close and others wandering
in wedge or line into the fields. In the town the
road loses itself, bewildered among islands made by inns
and groups of cottages, the church and the shops. Among
these pour a flock of sheep, swelling as the streets enlarge,
contracting as they contract, and always filling them.
Within the town there is not a blade of grass, nor a
garden, nor a tree; and yet the richly burning roofs, the
grey or white walls, the sign of “The Spotted Cow,” or
the sign of “The Sun,” make not an interruption but a
diversion in the fields, when suddenly, between two white
walls, shines the green evening land, and across it a busy
train rushes and vanishes with long, delicious, dying
reverberations among the dark woods and rosy clouds at
the horizon.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN OLD FARM</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The sun rose two hours ago, but he is not to be found
in the sky. Rather he seems to have disembodied himself
and to be lazily concealed in the sweet mist that lies
white and luminous over the half-mile of level meadows
at the foot of this hill. Those meadows are brown with
yet untouched grasses, grey and silken with the placid
ruffled waves of yesterday’s new swathes, and liquid
emerald where the hay has already been carted; and now
the brown, now the grey, now the emerald warms and
becomes visible under the feet of the light that dwells in
the mist. Beyond the level rises a low but sudden hill of
large, round-topped, colourless, misty trees, known by
their outline alone, and in the heart of them a moving
gleam as of sudden surf now and then, for there also the
sun is wandering and hiding himself but not his light. I
turn my head and, looking again, the sun is once more
in the sky, the mist has gone. The vast, hunched, hot,
purring summer country is clearly enjoying the light and
warmth. The swallows flying are joyous and vivid in
colour and form as if I had the eyes of some light-hearted
painter of the world’s dawn. Where the gleam was,
that haunt of the sun’s, that half-hour’s inn to which he
turns from the long white road of the sky to rest, is seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to be the white farm house that stands in the midst of
woods and ricks.</p>

<p>Yet, though so clear, the house, half a mile off, seems
to have been restored by this fair and early light and the
cooing of doves to the seeming happy age in which it
was built. The long, tearing crow of the cock, the clink
of dairy pans, the palpitating, groaning shout of the
shepherd, <em>Ho! ho! ho! ho! ho!</em> now and then, even the
whirr of the mowing machines, sound as if the distance
that sweetens them were the distance of time and not
only of space. They set a tune on this fair morning to
“What a dainty life the milkmaid leads” or that old
<span class="lock">song:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In those days when the house was built the poets were
mainly townsmen, preferring the town. Of the modern
sad passion of Nature they had nothing: they loved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fields in their season. They went out into the country
and in their <i>fêtes champêtres</i> there was something gay and
foreign from us, the thought of which calls up a vision of
fields more unspoiled than they are now. There were
elves in those days; country people saw them, if poets
failed. If you were returning home after nightfall, from
a day’s shooting, you might see the torches among the
oaks that lit the king of the cats to his grave. The
country had always been there and was to be there for
ever. Men greeted it and smiled as once they greeted
Helen, not thinking of her immortality. And there&mdash;yonder,
half a mile away&mdash;lingers that age. I see it in
the green and silver wheat, and its glimmering, rustling
hurry, and in the bright path beside; the very noises of
a gun rolling and breaking up and embedding themselves
in the dense wood cannot mutilate it, but rather hint
that somewhere, where the echoes last play, a spirit of
mirth is in hiding still.</p>

<p>The farmer himself confirms the superstition. Though
nearly seventy, he is staunch and straight, and spending
most of his day on horseback, with his calm, large-featured,
sandstone face, filling easily and handsomely with clear-souled
anger and delight, he suggests the thought of a
Centaur, an impossible, noble dream of horse and man
created by a god dissatisfied with man and beast. Thirty
centuries ago such a man, so marvellously in harmony
with the earth, would have gone down in men’s memories
as a demi-god or the best-loved of the fauns. His voice
rings over the meadows or across the table at the inn as
strong as a cow’s, as deep and humming and sweet as a
bee’s in a chimney. When he passes by men look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
him, I think, as if he cast no shadow, so compact of light
is he. He has known sorrow, he has known pains that
threaten to crack the brain, but never melancholy. There
is a kind of gaiety in his sorrow even as in his joy; for
sorrow changes him only as a shadow changes a merry
brook. He breathes of a day when men had not so far
outstripped the lark and nightingale in heaviness as we
have done. His jesting bathes the room or the lane in
the light of a Golden Age and the freshness of all the
May days we can never recover. Nor do I know anything
human more pleasant than his grave smiling as he
stands in the newly reaped cornfields under the last light
and sees the large purple land and takes it all unto himself,
and then turns without a sigh and, drawing a long
draught of his own cider in the cool granary, drinks deep.
He rises early and yet is as cheerful when he goes first
afield as when he goes to bed.</p>

<p>His house, dark with panelling and heavy furniture of
every generation since it was built, would be gloomy
were it not for his blithe sentiment about the past. He
speaks of the long-dead generations not as if they were
names, but so that they are known certainly to have lived
and worked and enjoyed. That one planted the spreading
oak, that globed green world of nightingale and
willow-wren and dove; that added the knolled pasture
and cut the deep, stony lane that leads to it through the
brook; another built the fruit wall and bought the copy
of <cite>Tristram Shandy</cite> that stands with a hundred other
books in the dining-room. The books themselves are
good to look at, all of them original or early editions.
There is <cite>The Whole Duty of Man</cite> and many sermons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Prior, <cite>The Spectator</cite>, Thomson’s <cite>Seasons</cite>, Fielding, <cite>The
Rambler</cite>, <cite>The Task</cite>, <cite>The Deserted Village</cite>, <cite>The Waverley
Novels</cite>, Dickens, and nothing later than <cite>In Memoriam</cite>;
at that the family seems to have stopped buying books.
He knows them shrewdly enough, but it is as what the
family has approved and lived on that he values them.
Never was a man who seemed to take his mortality so
happily and naturally. One day, showing me a small
board of ancient things, he brought out a tray of coins,
none earlier than Charles II., but each connected with
one or another of the family. Amongst them was a
modern sixpence. That was his third deposit, after the
guinea and the groat, and he was too much pleased with
these slender memorials not to do his own part in continuing
them. “What,” he said carelessly, “would they
think of me in a hundred years’ time if I had not put a
sixpence in?” And he smiled lightly as if he had been
on a hill and seen the long tracts of time ahead and his
farm and strangers of his own blood working in its
fields.</p>

<span class="smaller">POPPIES</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The earliest mower had not risen yet; the only sign
of human life was the light that burned all night in a
cottage bedroom, here and there; and from garden to
garden went the white owl with that indolent flight
which seems ever about to cease, and he seemed to be
the disembodied soul of a sleeper, vague, homeless,
wandering, softly taking a dim joy in all the misty, dense
forget-me-not, pansy, cornflower, Jacob’s ladder, wallflower,
love-in-a-mist and rose of the borders, before the
day of work once more began.</p>

<p>So I followed the owl across the green and past the
church until I came to the deserted farm. There the
high-porched barn, the doorless stables, the cumbered
stalls, the decaying house, received something of life
from the owl, from the kind twilight or from my working
mind. Above the little belfry on the housetop the flying
fox of the weather vane was still, fixed for ever by old
age in the south, recording not the hateful east, the
crude and violent north, the rainy west wind. Whether
because the buildings bore upon their surfaces the marks
of many generations of life, all harmoniously continuous,
or whether because though dead and useless they yet
seemed to enjoy and could speak to a human spirit, I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
not know, but I could fancy that, unaided, they were
capable of inspiring afresh the idea of immortality to one
who desired it. Mosses grew on the old tiles and were
like moles for softness and rotundity. A wind that elsewhere
made no sound talked meditatively among the
timbers. The village Maypole, transported there a
generation ago, stood now as a flagstaff in the yard, and
had it burst into leaf and flower it would hardly have
surprised. Billows of tall, thick nettle, against the walls
and in every corner, were a luxuriant emblem of all the
old careless ease of the labourers who, despite their sweat
and anxiety and hopelessness, yet had time to lean upon
their plough or scythe or hoe to watch the hounds or a
carriage go by. Tall tansy and fleabane and hawkweeds
and dandelions, yellow blossoms, stood for the bright joys
of the old life. The campions on the hedge, the fumitory
in the kitchen garden, meant the vague moods between
sorrow and joy, speaking of them as clearly as when from
out of the church flows the litany, charged with the
emotion of those who hear it not though lying near.
Had the wise owner admitted these things and for their
sake obeyed the command of the will which bade him
leave the Green Farm untouched? He might well have
done so had he seen the birth of colour after colour in the
dawn.</p>

<p>At first, when doves began to coo and late cuckoos to
call in invisible woods beyond, I thought that the green
of grass was alive again; but that was only because I
knew it was grass and could translate its grey. The
green trees were still black above a lake of white mist far
off when the yellows of hawkweed and tansy rose up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
The purple fumitory, the blue of speedwells, came later.
And then, as I turned a shadowy corner and came out
into the broad half light just before sunrise, I saw the
crimson of innumerable poppies that had a thought of
mist pearl enmeshed amongst them.</p>

<p>They were not fifty yards away&mdash;they were in a well-known
place&mdash;and yet there towered high walls and
gloomed impassable moats between them and me, such
was the strangeness of their beauty. Had they been
reported to me from Italy or the East, had I read of
them on a supreme poet’s page, they could not have been
more remote, more inaccessible, more desirable in their
serenity. Something in me desired them, might even
seem to have long ago possessed and lost them, but when
thought followed vision as, alas! it did, I could not
understand their importance, their distance from my
mind, their desirableness, as of a far-away princess to a
troubadour. They were stranger than the high stars, as
beautiful as any woman new-born out of summer air,
though I could have reaped them all in half an hour. A
book in a foreign, unknown language which is known to
be full of excellent things is a simple possession and
untantalising compared with these. They proposed
impossible dreams of strength, health, wisdom, beauty,
passion&mdash;could I but relate myself to them more closely
than by wonder, as a child to a ship at sea which, after
all, he may one day sail in, or of a lover for one whom
he may some day attain. I was glad and yet I fatigued
myself by a gladness so inhuman. Did men, I asked
myself, once upon a time have simply an uplifting of the
heart at a sight like this? Or were they destined in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
end to come to that&mdash;a blissful end? Had I offended
against the commonwealth of living things that I was not
admitted as an equal to these flowers? Why could they
not have vanished and left me with my first vision,
instead of staying and repeating that it would be as easy
to draw near to the stars as to them?</p>

<p>And yet the mind is glad, if it is troubled, of an impossible,
far-away princess. She deceives the mind as
Columbus deceived his weary sailors by giving out at the
end of each day fewer knots than they had truly travelled,
in order that they should not lose courage at the immensity
of the voyage.</p>

<p>And still the poppies shone and the blackbird sang from
his tower of ivory.</p>

<span class="smaller">AUGUST</span></h3>
</div>


<p>I have found only two satisfying places in the world
in August&mdash;the Bodleian Library and a little reedy,
willowy pond, where you may enjoy the month perfectly,
sitting and being friendly with moorhen and kingfisher
and snake, except in the slowly recurring intervals when
you catch a tench and cast only mildly envious eyes upon
its cool, olive sides. Through the willows I see the hot
air quiver in crystal ripples like the points of swords, and
sometimes I see a crimson cyclist on a gate. Thus is
“fantastic summer’s heat” divine. For in August it is
right to be cool and at the same time to enjoy the sight
and perfume of heat out of doors. In June and July the
frosts and east winds of May are so near in memory that
they give a satisfaction to the sensation of heat. In
September frosts and east winds return. August, in short,
is the month of Nature’s perfect poise, and I should like
to see it represented in painting by a Junonian woman,
immobile, passionless and happy in a cool-leaved wood,
and looking neither forward nor backward, but within.</p>

<p>Far off I see a forest-covered hill that says “Peace”
with a great, quiet voice. From the pool and towards
the hill runs a shining road, with some of its curves visible
for miles, which I have not followed and dare not follow,
because it seems to lead to the Happy Fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the pool and the road is a house built squarely
of white stone. A tiled roof, where the light is always
mellow as sunset in the various hues that sometimes mix
and make old gold, slopes from the many-angled chimneys
and juts out beyond and below the wall of the house. In
that shadowy pocket of the eaves the martins build, and
on a day of diamond air their shadows are as rivulets
upon the white wall. Four large windows frame a cool
and velvety and impenetrable gloom. Between them
stand four still cypresses.</p>

<p>A footpath skirts the pool, and on one side tall grasses
rise up, on the other thorns and still more grasses, heavy
with flowers and the weight of birds. The grasses almost
meet across the path, and a little way ahead mix in a
mist through which the white-throat and the dragon fly
climb or descend continually. The little green worlds
below the meeting grasses are full of the music of bright
insects and the glow of flowers. The long stems ascend
in the most perfect grace; pale green, cool, and pleasant
to the touch, stately and apparently full of strength, with
a certain benignity of shape that is pleasant to the eye
and mind. Branched, feathered, and tufted heads of
flower top the tall grass, and in the clear air each filament
divides itself from the rest as the locks of the river-moss
divide on the water’s flow. All bend in trembling curves
with their own fulness, and the butterflies crown them
from time to time. When wind plays with the perfectly
level surface of the grasses their colours close in and part
and knit arabesques in the path of the light sand martins.
Sometimes the mailed insects creep along the pennons of
the grass leaves to sun themselves, other insects visit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
forget-me-nots in the pool. Every plant has its miniature
dryad.</p>

<p>Nearer, and sometimes in the water, the branched
meadow-sweet mingles the foam of its blossom and the
profuse verdure of its leaves with willow herb, blue brooklime,
white cresses, and the dark purple figwort. A
mellow red, like that of autumn oaks or hawthorn at the
first touch of spring, tinges the meadow-sweet. The
disposition of its flowers is so exquisite that they seem to
have been moulded to the shape of some delicate hand;
every bud takes part in the effect. The lithe meanders
of the stems are contrasted with the intricacy of the
goose-grass and the contortion of the forget-me-nots.
Both in the midst of the long stalk and in the plume of
flowers the branching is so fine and the curves rely so
intimately upon one another that a simple copy on paper
is cool and pensive after the vanity of cultivated curiousness.
Hardly anywhere is there a visible shadow; at
most there is a strange tempering of pure light that
throws a delicate bloom upon the cattle and the birds,
and a kind of seriousness upon the face or flower within
its influence. A dark insect of clear wings alights upon
the new hawkweed flower, and sits probing deliciously in
its deep heart; but, although the petals are in the midst
of grasses and under thorns, the fly perches unshadowed,
and throws no shade beyond a moistening of the flower’s
gold. The close purple flowers of the vetches are scarcely
duller in the recesses, where the plant begins to climb,
than at the summit where the buds bear a fine down.
The fish gleam deep in the pool. The dark ivy shines in
the innermost parts of the wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>But these are merely the things that I see beside the
pool, and here, more than anywhere else, the things that
are seen are the least important. For they are but the
fragments of the things that are embroidered on the
hem of a great garment, which gathers the clouds and
mountains in its folds; and in the hair of the wearer
hang the stars, braided and whorled in patterns too intricate
for our eyes. The Junonian woman is a little
ivory image of the figure which I think of by the pool.
She is older than the pool and the craggy oak at its edge,
as old as the stars. But to-day she has taken upon herself
the likeness of one who is a girl for lightness and joy, a
woman for wisdom, a goddess for calm. Last month she
seemed to laugh and dance. Next month she will seem
to have grey in her hair. To-day she is perfect.</p>

<span class="smaller">OLD-FASHIONED TIMES</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The road curves gently but goes almost east and west;
on the north side is a bank surmounted by dense thorns;
on the south is a low hedge, over which can be seen two
broad meadows, with oaks here and there, running up in
shining bays among tall woods, and above and beyond
those woods several wooded ridges, hunched and blue, on
the last of them a windmill like a stag’s antlered head
that somehow hints at the sea beyond. His back thrust
into the northern hedge, an old man leans all the year
through, whenever the faint sun draws him forth, or he
(as it seems) draws forth the sun, for when the sun is out
he is there, and he moves round the curve of the road as
the sun moves. Coral-faced, white-haired, he is still
straight and tall, though his eyes, that resemble shellfish,
seem dissolving in rheum, and his face is stamped with
wrinkles like brookside mud where wagtails have played.
Apollo, when he disguised himself as an old man, must
have looked so. Most of all he loves to lean at the
corner from which the windmill is clearliest seen; and
thither he looks, though he cannot see it, with a serene
satisfaction. For not only did he pass his best manhood
close to that hill, but there, as he joyfully recalls, he once
climbed an ash tree for a sparrowhawk’s nest, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
descending, the miller wrapped a stinging whip about his
legs, so that he fell violently and in so doing broke the
miller’s nose; and that is why he looks towards the
windmill affectionately.</p>

<p>What times those were! Wages were low, but then
a labourer got many things cheap which others got dear;
for the making of a linen smock he paid a woman half-a-crown,
while a farmer had to pay four shillings, and the
smocking was the same. Also, in his worst days, if he
and his family had nothing on the table but turnip and
bread, he had given away two hundred seed potatoes to a
man who praised them. Besides, those were the “old-fashioned
times,” and in fifty or sixty years of toil, suffering
and, at length, some leisure, he has proved to himself
that they were good. “Some think,” said a passer-by to
him, “that the old-fashioned times were better than
these?”</p>

<p>“Think!” said he, “I know they were.” For surely
they were, since it was then that he used to drive a
glorious coach twice a week to London and now he does
not; and in those days there were “good people” in the
little town under the mill, and you knew who they were
and their grandfathers too, but who are they now?</p>

<p>And yet, he says, there used to be a great deal less
pride. In his young days the farmers and their sons went
to church and sang in the choir in their clean white
smocks; but now the church is like a gentleman’s conservatory.
“And, lord! where are the gentlemen now?
Many a gentleman looks like an ordinary man about
here, and there’s many an ordinary man looks like a
gentleman. That means a lot of awkwardness for those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that care. Now, in the old-fashioned times, we knew a
gentleman as soon as we could walk. There was the old
squire! He used to expect us to sing carols outside his
windows on Christmas Eve! then he would ask us into
the hall and give us good mulled ale and a shilling apiece&mdash;and
how he did give it! Not like a fellow putting a
halfpenny into the collection, nor like your good old
lady’s giving you a pair of gloves too small for you and a
tract, as much as to say it is more blessed to give than to
receive; but his look was as good as his shilling and
made you want to sing, and I believe the old gentleman
could no more have done without us than we could do
without him.”</p>

<p>He is simply a memory with a voice, both of them
slightly aided by a present of whisky from an old employer,
and in the sun of April he sprouts like any cottager’s
garden with alyssum and tulips.</p>

<p>Food is a great subject with him, and especially roast
pork, from which it is perhaps fair to conclude that it was
not often to be had. One bout of it he often recalls.
He was still in his prime, a big man of fifty, and though
he had been threshing all the morning&mdash;“it is a good
many ups and downs of the flail to a pound of pork,” he
says&mdash;he had eaten no food and he had none by him and
there was none in the house. Presently hunger so far
mastered him that he stopped work and took a walk round
the farmyard. There he saw a fat pig lying on his side,
heavy and making bacon rapidly. In a short time he had
laid his plans: lifting up his flail he began to thresh the
pig, and shouting above its screams: “Son of a fool, I’ll
teach you to eat my dinner.” Nor did he cease to beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the pig and to upbraid it for stealing his dinner until the
farmer came out and, pitying his case, sent him out a
dish of roast pork to make amends. Then he tells a
story to celebrate the incomparable joys of such a dish.
An old woman had died and two young wives came to
lay her out. After doing their work, they sat down on
the bed, talking of many matters. Soon they fell to discussing
pork. One said that it was best in the middle of
the day; the other that it was best at night; and the
debate was hot and threatened to be long, when the
corpse rose straight up in the bed and said in a gentle
voice that it was good at all times, then lay back in peace
and never moved again.</p>

<p>But it was wonderful how much could be done without
pork. He and two other men had mowed a seven-acre
field of grass, all but a bit,&mdash;and a good crop,&mdash;in one
long day, eating nothing but bread and cheese, and drinking
two gallons of new ale apiece. They began at half-past
two in the morning, one of them having cleared the
edges the night before with an old scythe, because the
ground was rough there with sticks and stones. They
moved in <i>échelon</i> up the field, he as the strongest mower
coming last in the row, so that he could always keep
them up to their work; for they had to keep ahead of
him lest his swathes should fall over their unmown grass.
At five they had the first meal, hardly sitting down to it,
for fear of losing time; then again at nine they ate, and
so on through the day. The rule for eating and drinking
was never to wait until they were really hungry or thirsty,
thus avoiding the necessity for a heavy meal and some
rest. At first, he said, they talked all the time, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
when they were carrying back their scythes to begin a
fresh swathe at the bottom of the field; but gradually
their talk grew less and less, and they finished in silence
at half-past nine. He recalled with pride that when he
first mowed barley, being a strong man, he used to take
three more drills in his swing than the other man, but in
a day’s work he had lost ground and he had to give up the
conceit.</p>

<p>But he is proudest of his coaching years and especially
of one day. It was a very fine April. The snakebirds
or wrynecks were screaming all along the road as he set
out. The horses were all shining, the white windmills
were turning with mad, downward plunges “fit to make
you mad.” So at the first stop, which was ten minutes,
off he went, and sure enough in the first shaw he came
to he heard the cuckoo, and as there was a big shallow
pond in the heart of the trees, all warm with sun, he
stripped and bathed, rejoicing all the time with the
thought that he would be able to drive the horses as fast
as he liked to make up for the delay. He could have
ridden a cow that day. He felt so proud that he wanted
to run down some foxhounds that crossed the road before
him, and all the way to London the horses’ hoofs beat
out his name&mdash;“Peter Durrant! Peter Durrant!”&mdash;as
they had never done before. Nowadays, he says, there is
not a pair of horses, that does not clatter: “Poor pluck
to-day! Poor pluck to-day!” which is what a team of
plough horses used to sing in his day, as they went home
in the afternoon. But so strong is his belief in the old
days&mdash;to which he belonged&mdash;from which he is an exile
in a foreign field&mdash;that he is never sad as he sits in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
sun. He condescends to live on with just such an air as
when an old man lays his hand on a boy’s shoulder and
encourages him. From his conspicuous life he is rather
well known, and it happened once that a poet with a
command of large margins once made some verses after
some misfortune had befallen him and recited them to
the old man by the wayside. “That is wonderful,” said
Peter, “wonderful! How ever did you think of all those
things about a poor old man like me? But ’tis lucky,
sir, that you were not the sufferer, or those beautiful things
would never have been written, for I could never have
thought of them myself.”</p>

<p>For the rest, he collects herbs and with the help of
Culpeper and some little experiment concocts fragrant
ointments and dark, painful draughts in which a dozen
flavours conflict; nor has he ever killed a man: he takes
them himself. He will bury his nose in a fragrant posy
brought home by the children and say gravely, and I
think with some dark wisdom, “Why, they must be good
for something,” and deeply inhaling, he continues, “At
least they are good for old age.” And his own old age
he attributes to the diet of living tadpoles which he used
against a decline, fifty years ago.</p>

<span class="smaller">ONE GREEN FIELD</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Happiness is not to be pursued, though pleasure may
be; but I have long thought that I should recognise
happiness could I ever achieve it. It would be health, or
at least unthwarted intensity of sensual and mental life,
in the midst of beautiful or astonishing things which
should give that life full play and banish expectation and
recollection. I never achieved it, and am fated to be
almost happy in many different circumstances, and on
account of my forethought to be contemptuous or even
disgusted at what the beneficent designs of chance have
brought&mdash;refusing, for example, to abandon my nostrils
frankly to the “musk and amber” of revenge; or polluting,
by the notice of some trivial accident, the remembrance
of past things, both bitter and sweet, in the
company of an old friend. Wilfully and yet helplessly
I coin mere pleasures out of happiness. And yet herein,
perhaps, a just judge would declare me to be at least not
more foolish than those men who are always pointing out
the opportunities and just causes of happiness which others
have. Also, the flaw in my happiness which wastes it to
a pleasure is in the manner of my looking back at it when
it is past. It is as if I had made a great joyous leap over
a hedge, and then had looked back and seen that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
hedge was but four feet high and not dangerous. Is it
perhaps true that those are never happy who know what
happiness is? The shadow of it I seem to see every
day in entering a little idle field in a sternly luxuriant
country.</p>

<p>It is but five grassy acres, and yet as the stile admitting
you to it makes you pause&mdash;to taste the blackberries or
to see how far the bryony has twined&mdash;you salute it in a
little while as a thing of character. Many of the fields
around are bounded by straight-ruled hedges, as if they
had been cut up by a tyrant or a slave, with only a few
of such irregularities as a stream or a pond may enforce.
Not one of the five hedges of this field makes a straight
line. The hedge up to your right from the stile is of a
noble and fascinating unruliness. So winds a mountain
stream down its ladders of crag in Cardigan; into some
such form would the edge of a phalanx be worn by long
swaying in the height of battle. The other hedges are
equally fretted. Here, there is a deep indentation where
the cattle lie and wear the blackthorn stems until they
are polished for ever; and there the knitted stoles and
roots of ash jut out and encroach, fierce and antique and
stony, like a strange beast left there to lie in the sweet
grass&mdash;like a worn effigy over a grave where knight and
hound have become mingled in monstrous ambiguity.
The surface of the field is of the same wildness. It does
not rise and fall in a few sea-like heavings, or in many
little waves, nor is it level or in one long, gradual slope,
but rising sleepily from west to east it is broken by sudden
hollows and mounds. In one place the furze on a mound
makes a little world for two or three pairs of linnets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
white-throats, and there are the largest and sweetest
blackberries; there also a hundred young stems of brier
spend spring and summer in perfecting the curves of their
long leaps&mdash;curves that are like the gush of water over a
dam, and yet crossing in multitudes without crowding, in
all ways without discord, like the paths of the flight of
swallows when they embroider the twilight air. In
another place it is always marshy, the home of marigold
and reed. One corner used to be dominated by a tall
tented oak, of so majestic balance that when sawn through
it stood long in the wind; there the pheasants are proud
among bugle or centaury flowers. Here and there a
smooth boulder protrudes, guarded by hundreds of blue
scabious flowers which welcome butterflies of their own
hue, and sometimes a peacock butterfly displays himself
on the naked stone.</p>

<p>At the eastern and higher end the field becomes so
narrow that it is like a lane, through which the hunt
gloriously decants itself among the knolls. It is narrowed
still more by a small pond, and round that a tall holly of
solid shadow with glancing edges, an oak, an overhanging
thicket of bramble and thorn and three old butts of ash,
where the fairy gold of toadstools is scattered abundantly
as if sown by one sweep of a generous hand. The pond
is the home of one moorhen, which is always either
swimming there or hastening to it from the field. It is
but as large as a farmhouse kitchen, and yet the moorhen
will not desert it, finding the eaves among the roots as
pleasing as attics to a boy; content with her seeming
security though the road passes just above, and rich in her
share of sun and moon and stars. To see the moorhen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
swimming in the narrow pond on a silent and misty
autumn morning is to think, now with joy, now with
pain, of solitude, but always with a reverie at last that is
entangled among the dim, late stars&mdash;she possessing the
solitary pond, in the solitary autumn country on a planet
that is but an element in the solitude of the infinite; and
her liquid hoot dwells long in the brain.</p>

<p>It is worth while to watch the pool at dawn, because,
though it might seem to be but one of the myriad waters
that light candles of adoration and celebration to every
dawn, it has then the air, as the mist drips and tingles at
the edge, of being a grey priest who has not yet done
serving other gods than the dawn, and, until it puts on
its white robes and glimmers altogether, it makes with
the oak tree a group of pathetic revolt against the day&mdash;the
oak might be a Saturn or a Lear, the pool in its
gradual surrender to the light a Druid sheltering dear
and unprosperous mysteries yet a little longer from the
proud sun. Then the thrush sings on the holly crest
with such blitheness as cannot, nevertheless, excel the
water’s glory in the fully risen light.</p>

<p>But whatever conversion the little pond undergoes on
dawn after dawn, the field as a whole retains the same
antiquity, which it announces so powerfully that I knew
it on first crossing the stile. Perhaps the lawless shape
of the field, its unusual undulations, its unkemptness in
the midst of a land all rich with crops&mdash;perhaps these
things suggested antiquity; but I think not&mdash;at least
they do not explain it for it was then strange, and now
with all its familiarity it has rather gained than lost its
power. It is the same when its outlines are concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
by mist and all I can see is the clover rough with silver
dew, white mushrooms, and perhaps one red yoke of
maple in the hollow air, and when the snow covers all
but the myriad thistles blossoming with blue tits. Enter
it in spring&mdash;the linnets sprinkle a song like audible sunlight&mdash;and
yet the field is old. But November is its
notable month. Its trees are all oaks and they have
hardly lost a leaf; the leaves are falling continually from
those smouldering sunset clouds of foliage, which, kingly
rich, look as if they would never be poor. One skylark
sings high over the field in the rainy sky. The blue
rooks unsheathe themselves heavily from the branches
and shine silverly and caw with genial voices. A pheasant
explodes from a grass tussock underfoot. The air
smells like the musky white wild rose; coming from the
west it blows gently, laden with all the brown and golden
savours of Wales and Devon and Wiltshire and Surrey
which I know, and the scent lifts the upper lip so that
you snuff deeply as a dog snuffs. A stoat goes with
uplifted tail across the field. But the field itself&mdash;was
there a great house here once and is it dead and yet
vocal? Are its undulations and rude edges all that remain
of an old wood? Or was there a battle here, and
is the turf alive with death? Certainly there is death
somewhere speaking eloquently to mortal men. It is
not alive, but it laments something, and where there is
sorrow there is life.</p>

<p>For just one day in September the goldfinches come
and twitter, and are happy among the thistles, and fly
away.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="smaller">THE BROOK</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The brook rises in a clear, grey, trembling basin at
the foot of a chalk hill, among flowers of lotus and
thyme and eyebright and rest-harrow. Here the stone
curlew drinks, and above is the gently rounded encampment,
ancient, and yet still young compared with the
dusky spring which has something gnomish and earthy
about it, though it takes the sun. It drops in thin, bright
links over the chalk, and then for a time loses its way in
playing with cresses and marsh marigolds, spreading out
so finely that hardly will the ladybird drown that falls
therein&mdash;falling at length in a cascade from one dead leaf
to another down a hedge bank. Below, it nourishes the
first forget-me-nots, by a gateway where it slips across
the lane, and is dew-fed by the vetches and clovers that
swaddle the posts of the gate. Now it is unheard and
unseen in the darkness underneath dog’s mercury leaves
until it has gained its first treble voice as, pausing by an
interrupting branch, it fills a hollow and pours over in
icy fingers to the ditch beneath. Here it has cuckoo
flowers and creeping jenny and butterbur to feed; thrushes
drink of it; beetles dart across it like scullers that dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
now and then upon their sculls. It learns now to sway
the cress, to bow the brooklime, to brighten the sides of
the minnows; the fledgling of the robin that falls into it
dies. It floats the catkin down, and out of it rises the
azure dragon fly. Sometimes it muffles its going in moss,
but in a little while it gushes through drains and falls and
falls with a now unceasing noise in a land where all the
hollows are full of apple trees, rough grey with dewy
clover, and through all the hollows winds the brook,
dappled by blossom, leaned over by the bee-cradling,
sleepy, meadow cranesbill flower; in its green bed the
watervoles wear their submerged pathways. Now men
have laid a slab of elm or of rude stone across it, and
from those they lean to drink at haymaking or harvest;
the children float on it pinnaces of bent reed, or set it to
turn waterwheels of ash bark, or dip their cans in it for
curving minnow or twisting tadpole or the little black
circlers that meet and divide and pursue for a few April
days. Already it has ranged along its margin rough,
leaning willows garlanded by purple ivy; and their leaves
that dip to the surface it will never allow to rest. The
briers still overleap it in their long dreaming curves.
The kingfisher sits over it and the small trout nestle in
its bed. It enters many an ash copse and fills it with
willow herb and meadowsweet and all juicy plants, figwort
and iris and orchis and hyacinth and reed, with
osiers and their mists of crimson and gold. Nymph-like
the brook brightens and curves its crystal flesh and waves
its emerald hair under the bridges at field corners, where
the brambles dip their blossoms, and the nightingale sings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and the sedgewarbler has its nest. For it the lonely
willows in the flat fields shed their yellow leaves most
pensively, like maidens casting their bridal garlands off.
Three flowering apple trees in one islanded angle on a
lawn of perfect grass, a most dream-worthy place, fit for
the footprints of the beautiful,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>seem all its own; for there it first makes a deep sound in
falling over a ledge among its own curded, quivering and
moonlit yellow foam. Thereafter it opens wide between
broad low banks from which the cattle can step and stand
among the reeds under serene tall ashes, and the lily petals
float upon it that catch against the branches and against
the hearts of men in distant towns. There, too, among
the lilies the brook first takes the stars into its heart, but
gaily with all its flowers and thick herbage and its rippling
fall never still amidst the arrow-headed reed. It moves
like the high autumn wain, followed by many children,
who have time to leave it and gather flowers and are yet
never left behind. The heron comes to it at dawn, knowing
from afar the dark pool where it curves under a steep
bank and grim oak roots, and slopes down to it solemn and
eager and alone in the winter morning. The sand-martin
and wagtail often pause in their flight and hover above
the placid water and the cool, reflected reeds and watermint.
Where it is all of one depth, between straight
banks of cowslip, the boys sit and let their feet waver in
the flood and then roll or plunge in, with shouts and
gurgling talk, while in the reeds, the dabchick waits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
with head just above water, trembling for her eggs or
cheeping young. On Sunday the country lover, cruel
all the week, brings his maid to the brook and, suddenly
tender and a little proud, shows her the moist, weed-covered
nest and delights in her melting eyes. Fed now
by other brooks, from its own hills and from little woodland
springs, the brook consents to spread into a pool in
an old garden, and in the sweet imprisonment of lily and
rose and iris and oleander lies as if asleep, an indolent
Leda contented with the white swan, and yet escaping
all the time, its wild soul rejoicing yonder beneath the
heavily overhanging honeysuckled thorns of the wide
meadows again. Under the white highway the brook
runs and lures men to lean from the parapet by the milestone
and look at the water and take up some coolness
and some bitterness from it when they return to the
blinding miles. Its course is marked by alders and willows,
shaping cornfield and pasture in divine meanders that seem
to have learnt rather to be contented with travelling than
to be eager for the goal. Could a man but wander in
that way once more, like the child in the field of flowers
so multitudinous that she did not know what to do, but
closed her eyes and was happy yet! Now the otter plays
there, and where the ash roots twist into many a cave.
Through leagues of country the brook runs, passing high,
silent woods and misty, hot, luxuriant, flowering thickets
and wet, cloudy copses full at evening of confused birds’
singing, which no one sees except the brook and the milk-white
heifer who crowns herself in white roses in the
shade as she stands in tall, moist, sumptuous angelica and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
watches her crowned image looking out of that fair sky
in purest waters; then, suddenly emerging from this
lowly country it falls into a river and is lost or seems
to be lost in the turbid, serious flow that is soon to know
the sea.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span class="smaller">AN AUTUMN GARDEN</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The cottage gardens are ceremonious and bright with
phlox and sunflower and hollyhock; the orchards are
yellow with apple, and of all sunburnt hues with plum;
in the descending lane you wade in a world of ragwort,
knapweed and Canterbury-bell, with your head in the
world of honeysuckle; and, parting the hazel branches to
seek their branching clusters, you see now and then in the
valley a farmhouse on whose walls and roofs the hues of
fruit and flower all meet harmoniously. They meet as
the colours of many pictures meet in some ancient palette,
or as Plato and Catullus and Sidney and Shelley meet in
some grey schoolmaster.</p>

<p>In every Autumn the farmhouse, with its old tiles and
new and its glowing bricks (suppressing easily a few of a
putrid blue scattered here and there), seems, in spite of its
age, to be a great new flower. It is the royal flower of
autumn. It expresses at once all that fruit and flower
upon the hill have been expressing laboriously and word
by word.</p>

<p>Perfect gay youth and sage antiquity are mingled in the
aspect of the house; just as, in an autumn dawn, the
gradual veiled golden pomp of serene victory speaks, to
one mood, of the happy and mellow antiquity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
world, but, to another mood, speaks of the sublime,
insurgent youth which all nights nourish and equip and
send forth over the land. In winter it is old; it has
apparently been long fortifying itself against the foreign
cold of the landscape, snowy white or windy grey. In
spring it is old; the green garlands it as in tender
mockery. In summer it is old; it is impatient of the
bragging rose on its walls and the multiplication of leaf
and flower. But in September it is at home, as if after
an exile; it remembers only pleasant things&mdash;the autumns
of two centuries, their harvest, their fruit, their blossom,
their hedgerow vintages of bryony and cornel and thorn,
their ruddy moons. Gathered about it are the farm
buildings of the same colour, stacks of dark hay, sharp-breasted
ricks of corn, maternal, warm oast-houses and
orchard and garden, all of the same family.</p>

<p>In the misty days, when no gleam falls from the warm
sky on grass or water or fruit, you would say that the sun
had stalled his horses for a season within the farmhouse
walls; so much they glow; so glorious are they. I have
seen the radiant cart-horses coming with grave nods
through the farmyard at dawn as if they were to be yoked
to the chariot of the sun; the red-haired carter was at
least a Phaeton, a son of Apollo if not Apollo himself.</p>

<p>The garden borders are discreetly furnished, so that
they are now as clouds in the neighbourhood of the sun,
doing it honour by their liveries. They are populous with
sun-flowers, hollyhocks (tall, solemn halberds at evening,
guarding the outmost edge and held up mysteriously), red-hot
pokers rising out of a lake of rose of Sharon and
nasturtium, into which run promontories and peninsulas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of snap-dragon, rocket, Shirley poppy, carnation and phlox
of every hue that white and red confederate can invent;
here and there fuchsia trees in rivers of autumn crocus,
great poppies and evening primrose, and at their feet, like
long, coloured shadows stretching away, red flax and
pansies and the recurved stone-crop which the tortoise-shell
butterfly loves. These bodies of colour change year
by year&mdash;in one autumn the pansies made a long, curled
purple dragon among all the rest; but always the taller
flowers look as if stopped short in the mazes of a dance
which is soon to be resumed. Between these two borders
are two little lawns divided by a path, whereon the
fanciful might see a little beam of the house’s influence
in the peacock butterfly that returns continually to one
stone, settling there as the wanton light cast on ceiling
and wall by a raised glass settles when the glass is put
down.</p>

<p>It is not a rich or choice garden, though a fitting one.
Yet an earlier head of the farmer’s family&mdash;a student of
allegorical prints and emblems, the designer of at least one,
in which his own garden had notoriously served as a model
for the Eden&mdash;was so much enamoured of the flowers
and the house that he came, towards the end of his life,
to think himself over-worldly in his esteem of them, but
failed to overcome it, and, a little before his death, in the
free wanderings of his mind, announced that he saw
Paradise, and that it was even as his garden was,
“nasturtiums and all, Jacob” (which was a thrust at the
said son, a disliker of those flowers)&mdash;except that the vainglorious
new carnations were not there.</p>

<p>Travelling beyond the garden, the house declares it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>s
lordship over four limes that stand before it, in the home
field, at just such a distance that the flying blackbird,
frightened from the garden, will stop there instead of going
to the hedge beyond. As far as to these trees the house
sends out its light and virtue. Approaching them from
the hills, the eye of the wayfarer first salutes the out-buildings,
the ricks and the elms; it turns to the house
and gratefully pauses there; and last it glides to the limes
and is at rest, delighted by that one lyric effort, yet with
a slight gravity&mdash;even a sigh&mdash;at the accomplishment of
its sweet toil. Then it is to be seen how noble is the
order of the four trees. They are not in circle, square or
line; they make no figure, except that they are in a sharp
curve, straightening out as it nears you, so that they have
a power as of the first ships of a fleet, coming into sight
round a promontory and suggesting majestic numbers.
At nightfall the swallows twitter among the topmost
branches, sweetly, trippingly, one at a time, or in pairs
and companies, for a little while. Suddenly lamps are lit
within the house.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="smaller">THE WALNUT TREE</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The immense, solitary, half-veiled autumn land is hissing
with the kisses of rain in elms and hedgerows and grass,
and underfoot the tunnelled soil gurgles and croaks.
Secret and content, as if enjoying a blessed interval of life,
are the small reedy pools where the moorhens hoot and
nod in the grey water; beautiful the hundred pewits
rising in ordered flight as they bereave the grey field and,
wheeling over the leagues that seem all their own, presently
make another field all a-flower by their alighting; almost
happy once more is the tall, weedy mill by the broken
water-gates, dying because no man inhabits it, its smooth
wooden wheels and shoots and pillars fair and clean still
under the red roof, though the wall is half fallen.</p>

<p>And in the heart of this, set in the dense rain, is a
farm-house far from any road; and round it the fields
meet with many angles, and the hedges wind to make
way, here, for a pond, deep underneath alders; there, for
some scattered parcels of hayrick, on a grassy plot, encircling
a large walnut tree; and for another pond, beside
an apple orchard, whose trunks are lean and old and bent
like the ribs of a wreck. A quadrangle of stalls, red tiled,
of grey timber&mdash;trampled straw in their midst&mdash;adjoins
the house, which is a red-grey cube, white-windowed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
with tall, stout chimneys and steep, auburn roof, and
green stonecrop frothing over its porch. In and out goes
a rutted, grassy track, lined by decapitated and still-living
remains of many ancient elms.</p>

<p>In the overhanging elm branches flicker the straws of
the long-past harvest, and the spirits of summers and
autumns long-past cling to grass and ponds and trees.</p>

<p>The walnut tree among the ricks is dead. Against its
craggy bole rest the shafts of a noble, blue waggon that
seems coeval with it; long ladders are thrust up among
its branches; deep in the brittle herbage underneath it
lean or lie broken wheels, a rude wooden roller, the lovely
timber of an antique plough, a knotted and rusted chain
harrow, and the vast wooden wedge of the snow-plough
that cleared the roads when winters were still grim. In the
soft, straight rain these things are a buried world, the
skeletons of a fair-seeming old life mingled with a sort
of pleasant tranquillity as on the calm dim floor of a
perilous main.</p>

<p>Half of the fruit trees are dead, save for their lichen and
moss and their nests in fork and niche and the robin
musing in the branches.</p>

<p>The duck pond, deep below, is all in shadow. The
alders lean over it. Some have fallen, and the moorhens
have built on them, and the round vole sits there or drops
off with the suddenness of fruit; but he cannot dive, for
a million dead leaves are sunk or floating in the purple
shallows.</p>

<p>Over all is the stillness of after harvest. Long ago the
gleaners went home under the frosty moon, and the last
wain left its memorial wisps in the elms. The rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
possesses all, and a strange, funereal evocation calls up the
bronzed corn again, and the heavy waggon and the grim,
knitted chests of the bowing horses as they reach the
bright-fruited walnut tree. The children laugh and run&mdash;who
remember it in the workhouse now&mdash;and in a
corner of the field the reaper slashes hatefully at the last
standing rows. The harvest-queen sits on the topmost
sheaves. They dance in the barn. Their voices are
blithe and sweet; for the rain has washed away their
flesh and quieted them now and recalls only golden hours,
which linger in this idle autumn place and do not die but
only hide themselves as sunlight hides itself in yellow
apples, in red roses, in crystal water, in a woman’s eyes.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="smaller">A GOLDEN AGE</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Almost at the end of a long walk, and as a small silver
sun was leaving a pale and frosty sky, we began to ascend
a broad, heaving meadow which was bordered on our
right, on its eastern side, by a long, narrow copse of ash
trees. At the top of the meadow, hardly a quarter of a
mile away, was a little red farmhouse&mdash;yet not so little
but that it rose with a maternal dignity among and above
the sheds and stables, its children, and, like it, of antique
red. The home and dependencies gave out a sense of
solidity, independence and seclusion. Our hearts acknowledged
at once that it was desirable, saluted it, and were
calmly glad at the sight.</p>

<p>At that moment the tumult of a windy day was
entirely gone. The north wind now lay dead upon the
long white clouds in the east. The smoke from the farmhouse
chimneys flowed southward along the top of the ash
trees in a narrow, motionless rivulet in the calm air. Far
off the hoofs of the returning hunt clattered decently, and
combined with the dim memory of the wind in trees and
sedge to give to the great meadow an emphasised tranquillity
like that which fills an invalid’s room when others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
are just audibly busy about and below. We walked
more and more slowly up the meadow. The red house
was clear and hard in the grey air, yet with a richness
and implicated shadow as of things submerged. Something
which it gave out abundantly filled our minds that
had for hours played with casual and untraceable thoughts
and images&mdash;descended like an enthusiasm among
criticisms. In a minute the house was beautiful; it
seemed to flower with the happiness of men and women
and little children living melodiously; there, we thought,
must be minds and bodies which, without carelessness
and without stupidity, found in life what some expect
from the future and some feign to remember in the past;
there was character and beauty and strength, which time
flowed over in vain. Hither, it seemed, had drifted upon
Lethe’s stream all the hopes and wishes and recollections
and unaccomplished dreams of unhappy men, and had
formed at last a blossoming island in the waste.</p>

<p>And some were enjoying that island now. The very
smoke from the chimneys had goodness in it. Even as
we walked we turned the moment past into a Golden
Age, except that, whenever we looked up towards the
house, we knew that all was not yet lost, and that a
golden age might still succeed the last. Overhead sailed
some little rosy clouds that were part of the blossom of
that house.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a fearless child ran into the garden and
blew a horn and disappeared. Then we knew that the
past moments had been as when, in the old tale, men saw
an anchor let down out of the clouds and rooted in the
ground, and, looking up saw a rope shaken as if to dislodge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the anchor, and heard the voices of sailors aloft in the
sky, and then saw a man clambering down the rope and
dying at last, as if he had been drowned in the air which
they breathed easily, and the voices aloft were heard no
more.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="smaller">THE VILLAGE</span></h3>
</div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The village stands round a triangular, flat green that has
delicate sycamores here and there at one side; beneath
them spotted cows, or horses, or a family of tramps; and
among them the swallows waver. On two sides the
houses are close together. The third, beyond the sycamores,
is filled by a green hedge, and beyond it an apple
orchard on a gentle hill, and in the midst of that a farmhouse
and farm-buildings so happily arranged that they
look like a tribe of quiet monsters that have crawled out
of the sandy soil to sun themselves. There the green
woodpecker leaps and laughs in flight. Down each side
of the green run yellow roads that cross one another at
the angles, two going north, two going south, and one
each to the east and west. Along these roads, for a little
way, stand isolated cottages, most of them more ancient
and odd than those in the heart of the village, as if they
had some vagrant blood and could not stay in the neat
and tranquil community about the green. Thus, one is
built high above the road and is reached by a railed flight
of stone steps. The roof of another slopes right to the
ground on one side in a long curve, mounded by stonecrop
and moss, out of which an elder tree is beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
grow; and it has a crumbling tiled porch, like an oyster
shell in colour and shape. One has a blank wall facing
the road, and into the mortar of it, while it was yet fresh,
the workmen have stuck fragments and even complete
rounds of old blue and white saucers and plates. In
others the mortar is decorated by two strokes of the
trowel forming a wedge such as is found on old urns. In
the ruinous orchard by a fourth, among nettles and
buttercups, there is always a gipsy tent and white linen
like blossom on the hedge. One of these houses seems
to have strayed on to the green. Years ago someone
pitched a tent there, and in course of time put an apple
pip into the ground close by and watched it grow. The
codling tree is now but a stump, standing at the doorway
of a black wooden cottage named after it. Between it
and the village pond go the white geese with heads in
air.</p>

<p>Off one of those roads the church lifts a dark tower
along with four bright ash trees out of a graveyard and
meadow which are all buttercups. On three of the others
there are plain, square, plastered inns, “The Chequers,”
“The Black Horse,” “The Four Elms,” where tramps
sit on benches outside, and within the gamekeepers or
passing carters sit and wear a little deeper the high curved
arm-rests of the settles. But the chief inns stand opposite
one another at one corner of the green, “The Windmill,”
and “The Rose,” both of them rosy, half-timbered
houses with sign boards; the one beneath a tall, rocky-based
elm which a wood-pigeon loves, the other behind a
row of straight, pollarded limes; and opposite them is a
pond on the edge of the green. In these inns the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>farer
drinks under the dark seventeenth-century beams;
the worn pewter rings almost like glass; moss and ivy
and lichen, and flowers in the windows, and human
beings with laughter and talk and sighs at parting,
decorate the ancient walls. The lime trees run in a line
along the whole of one side of the green, and at their
feet still creeps a stream whose minnows hover and dart,
and the black and white wagtail runs. Behind the trees
are half the cottages of the village, some isolated among
their bean rows and sunflowers, some attached in fantastic
unions. Most are of one storey, in brick, which the
autumn creepers melt into, or in timber and tiles perilously
bound together by old ivy; in one the Jacobean
windows hint at the manor house of which other memory
is gone; all are tiled. Their windows are white-curtained,
with geranium or fuchsia or suspended campanula,
or full of sweets, and onions, and rope, and tin
tankards, and ham, and carrot-shaped tops, dimly seen
behind leaded panes. Between the houses and the limes,
the gardens are given up to flowers and a path, or they
have a row of beehives: in one flower-bed the fragment
of a Norman pillar rests quietly among sweet rocket
flowers. Instead of flower gardens, the wheelwright and
the blacksmith have waggons, wheels, timber, harrows,
coulters, spades, tyres, or fragments, heaped like wreckage
on the sea floor, but with fowls and children or
a robin amongst them, and perhaps, leaning against the
trees, a brave, new waggon painted yellow or red or
all blue.</p>

<p>On the other populous side of the green the houses are
of the same family, without the limes; except that far back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
among its lilac and humming maple foliage and flower,
is the vicarage, a red, eighteenth-century house with long,
cool, open windows, and a brightness of linen and silver
within or the dark glimmer of furniture, and a seldom
disturbed dream of lives therein leading “melodious
days.” Of how many lives the house has voicelessly
chronicled the days and nights! It is aware of birth,
marriage, death; into the wall is kneaded a record more
pleasing than brass. With what meanings the vesperal
sunlight slips through the narrow staircase window in
autumn, making the witness pause! The moon has an
expression proper to the dwellers there alone, nested
among the limes or heaving an ivory shoulder above the
tower of the church.</p>

<p>From one side to the other the straight starlings fly.</p>

<p>Along the roads go waggons and carts of faggots, or
dung, or mangolds in winter; of oak bark in spring;
of hay or corn in summer; of fruit or furniture in
autumn.</p>

<p>A red calf, with white hind legs and white socks on
her forelegs, strays browsing at the edge of the road. A
close flock of sheep surges out of the dust and covers the
green.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>We were twelve in the tap of “The Four Elms.”
Five tramps were on one side; on the other, six pure-blooded
labourers who had never seen London, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
seventh. A faggot was burning in the hearth, more for
the sake of its joyful sound and perfume than for its heat.
The sanded floor, cool and bright, received continually
the red hollowed petals that bled from a rose on the table.
The pewter glimmered; the ale wedded and unwedded
innumerable shades of red and gold as it wavered in the
mystic heart of the tankard. The window was held fast,
shut by the stems of a Gloire de Dijon rose in bloom,
and through it could be seen the gloom of an ocean of
ponderous, heaving clouds, with a varying cleft of light
between them and the hills which darkened the woods
and made the wheat fields luminous.</p>

<p>Now and then a labourer extended his arm, grasped
the tankard, slowly bent his arm whilst watching a gleam
on the metal, and silently drank, his eyes lifted as if in
prayer; then slowly put it back and saw a fresh circle
being formed around it by the ale that was spilled.</p>

<p>The tramps leaned on a walnut table, as old as the
house, polished so that it seemed to be coated with ice,
here and there blackened with the heat transferred to it
by a glass bottle standing in the sun. They looked at
one another, changed their attitudes and their drinks,
gesticulated, argued, swore and sang. They became
silent only when one of their number hammered a tune
out of the reluctant piano. They were of several ages
and types, of three nationalities, and had different
manners and accents. One was a little epicurean Spanish
skeleton who loved three things, his own pointed beard,
a pot of cider, and the saying of Sancho Panza: “I care
more for the little black of the nail of my soul than my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
whole body.” He was a grasshopper in the fields of
religion, scandal and politics, and wore his hat scrupulously
on one side. Another was a big, gentle Frenchman,
with heavy eyelids, but a fresh boy’s laugh. Early
in the evening he scourged the republic; later he laughed
at the monarchy, the consulate and the empire; and as
he went to sleep touched his hat and whispered “Vive
la France!” His neighbour was fat, and repeated the
Spaniard’s remarks when they had been forgotten. It
was to be wondered when he walked, what purpose his
legs were made to serve. At the inn it was to be seen
that they were a necessary addition to the four legs of a
chair. He wanted nothing but a seat and not often
wanted that. He was, I may say, made to be a sitting
rather than a sapient animal, and had been lavishly
favoured by Nature with that intention. The fourth, a
pale, sour anarchist, hardly ever spoke, but was apparently
an honest man, whom his indignant fellows called
“parson.” The last was one that been born a poet, but
never made one. He sang when he was asked, and later
when he was asked not to sing; very quietly and very
bitterly he cried when he had sung, indulging in a debauch
of despair. Before we parted, the twelfth man sang all
the sixteen verses of “Sir Hugh of Lincoln,” in the hope
of quenching their love of interminable songs. “Heaven
and Hell!” said the tramp, “ye make me feel as if I was
like Sir Hugh and Lady Helen and the Jew’s daughter all
in one. Curse ye! bless ye!”</p>

<p>Half way through the evening the tramps were asleep.
The labourers were as they were at the beginning. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sat a-row according to age, and nothing but age distinguished
them. Their opinions were those of the year in
which they were born; for they were of that great
family which, at the prime of life or earlier, seems to
begin growing backwards, to quote “grandfather,” more
often, and thus to give the observer a glimpse of the Dark
Ages. Life to them was at once as plain and as inexplicable
as the patterns on their willow cups or toby jugs.
The eldest had a gift of dumbness that sometimes lasted
nearly half a century, but once set going and wandering
from ploughs to horses, and from horses to the king, his
loyalty brought this <span class="lock">forth:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“If that Edward wasn’t king he ought to be.” Advancing
to the subject of hay with a digression on the
church, “Which,” said the youngest, “which came first,
parson or hay?”</p>

<p>“What,” said the eldest in a short speech that occupied
an hour of time, without interruption from the rest, who
drank through his periods and sat watching him while he
drank in the intervals by way of semi-colon. “What is
church for but rector to pray in? The parson prays for&mdash;for
a good season, and a good season means a good
hayrick like a church; well, then, Robert, George,
Henry, and Palmston, I say that the day after they
first wanted a rick they put up a church and put rector
in to pray. I,” continued he, growing confident, “remember
the Crimea. I had but four boys then, but
bad times they were. But we had tea, we had tea;
the wife used to grate up toast and pour boiling water
on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“We called that coffee,” said the youngest, a lover of
truth.</p>

<p>As the evening darkened and pipes went out and the
scent of carnations came in with the wind, their speech
became slower, with long intervals, as if they spoke only
after ploughing a furrow. One by one they seemed to
go out like the candles overhead, were silent, but never
slept. The oldest, reddest and roundest of face, with
white hair, looked like the sun at a mountain crest. The
next seemed to be the spirit of beneficent rain, pale,
vague, with moist eyes and tangled grey beard. The third
was as the south wind, mild, cheerful, pink-faced, with a
great rose in his button-hole. The fourth was the west
wind, that lifts the hay from the level fields into the
clouds at a breath, that robs the harebell of its dew and
stores it with rain&mdash;a mighty man with head on breast,
and small hands united, and flowing hair. And the
youngest was the harvest moon, glowing, with close hair
and elusive features, a presence as he sat there rather than

white wall.</p>

<p>“Well, us have had fun, haven’t us, George?” said
the harvest moon. He received no answer as we passed
out of “The Four Elms,” for all but he had left the
world where words are spoken and opinions held; and
the hazel lane seemed to be a temple of the mysterious
elements that make the harvest and the apple crop and
the glory of the hops.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Walking in a country churchyard it is often hard to
think of it as a place of death. The children play among
the tombs. At Easter the village girls bring hither primroses
from the woods, planting some, scattering others.
Labourers meet and talk there, for the footpaths all converge
towards the church. Lovers walk there. The
gravedigger is indeed often busy there, but you may go
many times and not find him at a grave, and it is seldom
but he is planting flowers, pruning bushes, or mowing
grass. On the tombs themselves, in epitaph or in lack of
epitaph, is written the corporate wisdom of the village,
its philosophy and its history half transmuted into poetry.
Fancy can never be quiet as the eye passes from Mary
to Rebecca, from John to David, whose record let no
one interpret untenderly. I have seen on an afternoon
many a novel that shall never be written save as it is
written here, deep without gloom, bitter without scandal,
on those tablets that have kept their legends too long to
be altogether fair. Even the harshest brevity has its
fitness, as if it were penned by the right hand of Fate.
And here, as in some other matters, we have made
an insignificant advance upon our ancestors. The chief
records of early races are their tombs. We know not
so much that they lived as that they are dead. We
guess at their lives from their dead bones. A tool, a
weapon, a trinket, a favourite beast, is buried with them,
conferring a life in death. In some ancient graves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
bodies are found in a sitting posture, and if conjecture be
just, we may suppose that the dead man once slept thus
and dreamed, daring not to lie down, because no clothes
kept off the frost or rain. So the endeavour to provide
for an after life by utensils and food has not been wholly
in vain. But “Tombs,” said the poet, “have their life
and death.” The headstone is heir to the deceased and
out in the world seeks a fortune, which is commonly bad.
The fates of tombs have seldom been traced. The history
of the epitaph has never been written. Thus is much
common philosophy hidden away. Probably no body of
literature could be found that is more fertile in homely
truth and fancy. But collections of epitaphs either have
no plan, or are intended to show only what is curious,
brilliant, or very old.</p>

<p>In this little churchyard a chapter or two of history
and progress is easily seen. At the middle of the eighteenth
century the sexton wrote the epitaphs, dealing out
eulogy and fact with a generous hand. After him came
a series of nonentities, whose epitaphs are as like one
another as Windsor chairs. Honest regret, or “smiling
through tears,” was ousted by complacent joy at the
celestial lot of the deceased. Decent friendship was replaced
by encomiastic fraud. Like all fashions it was
feeble, but like all fashions it had some good; it produced
models of accurate expression of “not what he was, but
what he should have been.” Then in the nineteenth
century followed a silent age. “He was alive, and is
dead;” tombstones with such inscriptions are like men
who do not speak in company, and unlike them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
never disappoint. They say, at anyrate, not more than
is written of honest men in heaven. The children of
those silent people did little but irrelevantly quote or
paraphrase the Bible and Dr. Watts. The epitaphs were
now thought worthy of a clear, large type; the fashion
at least taught children to spell. Some there were who
gained no small village reputation by a diligent study of
these sentences. Even the wiser pillars of the village,
whether they could read or not, were sure of awe and admiration
among their audience, if their speeches&mdash;political,
religious, or scandalous&mdash;were launched by “As the great
Dr. Watts wrote ...” or “In the words of Amos,
whom you may know....” Not of this period, but
first notorious then, was the epitaph on Sir &mdash;&mdash;, Bart.
His family, being still one of splendour and influence,
everything connected with it was held in esteem. It
was, therefore, not unnatural that the admirers of an aged
spinster should put upon her tomb the epitaph that was
picked out with letters of gold on that of the young
<span class="lock">baronet&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“The good die young.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Strangers are apt to wonder first at the longevity common
in the parish&mdash;then at the humour of the thing&mdash;and go
away both contented and deceived. For some time it
was not uncommon to quote a grave passage from Shakespeare,
with decent omission of the author’s name; when,
however, a revolutionist not only published “Shakespeare”
on a headstone, but “Romeo and Juliet” too, the vicar
was approached, the sexton ran a risk every day, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
inn-keeper, the J.P. was approached. The bereaved person
had in the meantime erased the offending words, and
until recently you might <span class="lock">read&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“God rest his soul! He was a merry man,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>beneath which the curious eye may still discover “Kings
iii.” placed there in homage to parish prejudice. The
storm almost raised by the introduction of two lines by
Robert Burns&mdash;“a poet as well as a drunkard,” according
to village rumour&mdash;is still remembered. The parish clerk
having doubted whether it was in “Ancient and Modern”
took refuge in the book of Ecclesiastes, until a confidant
(a fearless thinker and a friend of Chartists) swore it was
written by a lord. The vicar was questioned. Opening
a book whose cover was well known to the doubter, and
repeating with nasal unction the offending words, he drew
tears and apologies from the man. After that comparative
freedom of choice was enjoyed, and some went bravely
back to</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Afflictions sore long years I bore,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>as recently as 1885. Tennyson was in favour at that
time; no one grumbled since he was the author of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“That good man, the clergyman.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But when I brush aside the leaves and flowers of herb
honesty, growing by the older graves, although I am
willing to admit that the village view of death has
become more solemn, I cannot but wish back again the
author of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“This world has lost old John the sexton,</div>
       <div class="verse">What business has he in the next one?”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>Where are the robuster views of which this is a late
reminder? The gay, the fanciful, the calmly elaborate
epitaphs seem to have gone for ever, and in the newer
portion of the churchyard it is hard not to think of death,
unless we turn to the unnamed little mounds that rise
and fall like summer waters, so calm, so soft, so green,
that fancy cannot make them aught save pillows for the
weary. I have seen a tramp sleeping there and envied
him his unconscious return to the good old <i>insouciance</i>
which was warm with the thought that in the midst of
death we are yet alive.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>From the churchyard run twelve footpaths; some
ending at farmhouses close by; some losing themselves
in the nearest road; one leading nowhere, nor of any use
to-day, since the house which drew it thither across the
wheat is under the cow-parsley and grass; one going on
without end, touching here and there a farmhouse, crossing
a road, passing in at the door of an inn and out
through the garden, as if some friendly man had made
the path by following his heart’s desire. Most of the
paths led up on to the hills among which the village is
set. From the highest part, in spring, the warmth and
life of the scene below contrast strangely with its immense
age, as the new brazen leaves of the oak with their
ancient trunk. The houses are old, the church older,
the farm wall yonder is partly the remains of a castle of
Norman date. The hedges twist so fantastically because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
they also are old, marking ancient paths, the edges of
departed woods, the gradually advancing line of men’s
camp fires overcoming the wilderness. In that hollow
the gemote used to sit. Here a company of cavalry
charged down the hill and to a man went over the chalk
pit to the road and to death. There stood an abbey, now
speaking only through a curve added to the undulations
of the land. In the next village a poet was born. A
dolmen rises out of the wheat in one field, like a quotation
from an unknown language in the fair page of a book.
The names of the places are in the same language, and
yet how smoothly they issue from the lips. The little
roads, so old, wind among the fields timidly as if they
marked the path of one creeping with difficulty through
forest coeval with the world. Some roads have disappeared&mdash;there
where the wheat grows thin in a narrow band
across the field. Another is disappearing; worn to the
depth of some feet below the surrounding fields by the
feet of adventurers, lovers, exiles, plain endurers of life,
its end is to become a groove full of hazels and birds, the
innermost kernel of the land, because nobody owns and
nobody uses it. In contrast with those, how certain of
its aim the great road running east and west, the road of
conqueror, pilgrim, merchant, the embodiment of will
and opportunity; and that, too, so old that heron and
rook seem to recognise it as they go over at nightfall.
There is no age that does not play its part in the
symphony of this June scene. And yet, standing still
upon the ridge commanding it, when the roads are overhung
by the blythe new green of beech leaves and paved
with their ruddy chaff, these things become a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
silence and clear air which they trouble and enrich as do
the storied pavements and walls of a cathedral, thrilling
the ear and shaming the powers of the eye, so that in the
end the mind vibrates with the strangely interwoven
melodies of joy in the life that still triumphs within us,
and of acquiescence in the death which will leave of us
not so much trace as can add to the silence and clear air
one tone audible to mortal men.</p>

<span class="smaller">ST. MARTIN’S SUMMER</span></h3>
</div>


<p>In November I returned for a day to a lonely cottage
which I had known in the summer; and all its poppies
were gone. Here and there, in the garden, could be
found a violet, a primrose, a wood sorrel, flowering; the
forget-me-nots and columbines had multiplied and their
leaves were dense in the borders; the broad row of
cabbages gleamed blue in a brief angry light after rain;
the black currant leaves were of pure, translucent amber
at the ends of the branches. In the little copses the oaks
made golden islands in the lakes of leafless ash, and the
world was very little in a lasting mist.</p>

<p>Yet it was not impossible to reach greedily ahead to
spring, and I was doing so, in spite of the incredibly early
fall of night amid the whirling and crying of lapwings,
when, suddenly, a dead elm tree spoke of the summer that
was past. Dead, it had been worn by the summer landscape
as a memorial, as a “reminiscential amulet.” It
alone was now still the same, and strangely it spoke of
the summer which it had not shared; and I recalled
swiftly a night and daybreak of July.</p>

<p>All night we had sat silent with our books. There was
no other company within a mile save that of the tall clock,
with a face like a harvest moon, which did not tick, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
stood silent with hands together pointing at twelve o’clock,
seeming to rest, and to be content with resting, at the
tranquil and many-thoughted midnight which it had so
often celebrated alone until we came. But we were glad
of the clock. It allowed us to measure the rich summer
night only by the changing enchantments of Burton’s and
Cervantes’s and Hudson’s page, and by the increasing
depth of the silence which the owl and restless lapwing
broke no more than one red ship breaks the purple of a
wide sea. It is a commonplace that each one of us is
alone, that every piece of ground where a man stands is a
desert island with footprints of unknown creatures all round
its shore. Once or twice in a life we cry out that
we know the footprints; we even see the boats of the
strangers putting out from the shore; we detect a
neighbouring island through the haze, and creatures of like
bearing to ourselves moving there. On that night a high
tide had washed every footprint away, and we were
satisfied, raising not a languid telescope to the horizon, nor
even studying the sands at our feet.</p>

<p>Not less strangely or sweetly than it creeps in among
dreams, came in the whisper of the first swallows of the
dawn among our books; and Cleopatra, the cat, slipped
out through the window and left me.</p>

<p>But it happened that I rose and drew a curtain aside to
see whether she went to the woods or to the barn. The
night was over. The pool at the bottom of the garden
was glazed and dim and slightly crumpled, like the eye of
a dead bird; and all its willows were grim.</p>

<p>In the garden there was a bee. A little wind broke up
the poppies petal by petal, so that they vanished like fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
children in the midst of their perfections&mdash;cut off, and
marked in the memory chiefly by the blank they leave,
and not by an abundance such as older people entail upon
us to mimic life. Hardly had I ceased to watch them
than it was day. The cattle in a distant meadow stood
still at the edge of their own shadows as if at the edges of
pools. The dead elm tree seemed but a skull-capped,
foolish jester who set a sharper edge upon our appetite for
summer and the sun. The corn, the woods, rejoiced.
The green woodpecker laughed and shone in his flight,
which undulated as if he had been crossing invisible
hedges. A south-west wind arose and rain fell softly,
yet not so soothingly but that an odd thought thrust
itself into my mind.</p>

<p>I thought of how Cervantes was not enjoying it, and
in a moment I saw him and Burton and Wordsworth and
Charles Lamb close by, crouching and grey, as if they had
been buried alive, under knotted cables of oak root, deep
under the earth which was then bearing carnation and
wild rose. The wind found out the dead elm tree and
took counsel in its branches and moaned, although the
broad light now reigned steadfastly over leagues of shining
fields.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PRIDE OF THE MORNING</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The sun has been up for an hour without impediment,
but the meadows are rough silver under a mist after last
night’s frost. The greens in cottage gardens are of a
bright, cold hue between blue and grey, which is fitter
for the armour of heaven, or the landscape of some strong
mystic, than for one who loathes to leave his bed. The
blackbirds are scattering the frost, and they live in
glittering little hazes while they flutter in the grass.</p>

<p>But the sky is of an eager, luminous pale blue that
speaks of health and impetuousness and success. Across
it, low down, lie pure white clouds, preserving, though
motionless, many torn and tumultuous forms; they have
sharp edges against the blue and invade it with daggers
of the same white; they are as vivid in their place in
that eager sky as yews on a pale, bright lawn, or as
lightning in blue night. If pure and hale intelligence
could be visibly expressed, it would be like that. The
eyes of the wayfarer at once either dilate in an effort for
a moment at least to be equal in beauty with the white
and blue, clear sky, or they grow dim with dejection at
the impossibility. The brain also dilates and takes deep
breaths of life, and casts out stale thought and coddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
emotion. It scorns afterthought as the winds are flouting
the penitent half moon.</p>

<p>A squadron of wild fowl races through the crystal air;
the mind expands with their speed, and tries to share it,
and believes that it succeeds. A heron goes over solemnly,
high up, and as if upon some starry business in that profound,
bright air; the mind at once attunes itself to that
majesty and directness and <span class="lock">simplicity&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“And each imagined pinnacle and steep</div>
       <div class="verse">of godlike hardship.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A starling sits on the weathercock with ruffled feathers
watching the sky with one eye and then with the other,
and his form and voice are sharp and pure as they joyfully
pierce the air. The weathercock itself shines like Mars.
Together, they speak of the cold and vigour and health
and beauty which abide somewhere in the sky to-day
and not inaccessibly.</p>

<p>High above me, here and there upon the road, stand
oast-houses, with their conical roofs ruddy against the
sky, and over them the newly painted white cowls point
eastward, and in their whiteness seem to have been set as
a signal to say that it is the west wind after frost that has
made the world what it is; they point out a road which,
if I could follow it, would lead to the very court of mind
and beauty, yonder, afar off, where the wind and the
heron and the wild ducks are going. There I might
learn to realise the long, joyous curves in which thought
and action and life itself sweep onward to their
triumphs....</p>

<p>But I know well that long hopes and wide, vaulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
thoughts are not usually nourished by lane and footpath
and highway, on and on; and probably I shall stop at
“The Black Horse” over the next hill, where a man
may always lighten his burden on a Tuesday by hearing
the price of beasts.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE METAMORPHOSIS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>As the sun rose I watched a proud ash tree shedding its
leaves after a night of frost. It let them go by threes and
tens and twenties; very rarely, with little intervals, only
one at a time; once or twice a hundred in one flight.
Leaflet&mdash;for they fall by leaflets&mdash;and stalk twirled
through the windless air as if they would have liked to
fall not quite so rapidly as their companions to that brown
and shining and oblivious carpet below. A gentle wind
arose from the north and the leaves all went sloping in
larger companies to the ground&mdash;falling, falling, whispering
as they joined the fallen, they fell for a longer time
than a poppy spends in opening and shedding its husk in
June. But soon only two leaves were left vibrating. In
a little while they also, both together, make the leap,
twinkling for a short space and then shadowed and lastly
bright and silent on the grass. Then the tree stood up
entirely bereaved and without a voice, in the silver light
of the morning that was still young, and wrote once more
its grief in complicated scribble upon a sky of intolerably
lustrous pearl.</p>

<p>But by the next day the grief was healed, for what was
clearest about its branches was the swiftness and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>ward
rushing and curving flight which they suggested&mdash;as
of birds stooping in lines to their tree-top nests&mdash;as of
divers at the moment when their descent mingles with
their ascent&mdash;as of winged Greek gods and goddesses
slanting to earth with wave-like breasts.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Their house is a small russet cave of three dim compartments&mdash;part
of a farmhouse, the rest having fallen to
ruin, and from human hands to the starlings, the sparrows,
and the rats. No one will live in it again. Inside, it is
held together by the solid poetry of their lives, by gay-coloured,
cheerful, tradesmen’s pictures of well-dressed
children and blooming horsewomen, and the dogs of
gentlemen, memorial cards of the dead, a few photographs,
some picture post-cards pasted over flaws in the wall, and
the worn furniture of several disconnected generations.
The old man’s tools in the kitchen are noble&mdash;the heavy
wrought iron, two-toothed hoe, that falls pleasantly upon
the hard clay and splits it without effort and without
jarring the hand, its ash handle worn thin where his
hand has glided at work, a hand that nothing will wear
smooth; the glittering, yellow handled spades and forks;
the disused shovel with which he boasts regretfully that
he could dig his garden when he lived on deep loam in a
richer country than this; and still the useless “hop-idgit”
of six tynes&mdash;the Sussex “shim”&mdash;which he retains to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
remind others, and perhaps himself, that he was a farmer
once. He had twenty or thirty acres and a few cows.
The cows all died in one year and he became a
labourer.</p>

<p>His wife remembers those days. She was a tall woman
and stooped at the doorway thatch: now she cannot rise
to it. For every day she went many times to the sweet
brook, a quarter of a mile away, rather than take the grey
liquor of the pond for her cows. That is how she came
to be bent like an oak branch on which children swing,
or like a thorn that knows the west wind on the hill or
the shore. Now she cannot carry a pail, for it would
sweep the ground. She cannot see the apples in autumn
until they have fallen to her feet. Her flesh seems to
have assumed an animal sweetness, for her bees will cluster
on the brown hands. Birds and beasts take to her as to
an old tree, though she has pity for them, but no love.
Sometimes as she sits at her door the robins come fearlessly
close to her&mdash;hedge-sparrows, too, if there is nobody
else near, and even the partridges that come for the ants
in the old dock roots. She watches them with her dull
eye and seems easily to have found a Franciscan friendliness
when, as if angry with the creatures for seeing her frailty,
she stamps her feet and drives them away. Then she
relents and tries her power, as if she has half persuaded
herself that it is a happy talent. She will crush a mouse
in her fingers, and yet they still run over her in their
merry business night or day, as they would over a tree
that has fallen, and proved fatal to some of them in its
death. Yet, in spite of her apparent indifference, I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that she knows the animals more than we who patronise
them. Left alone with a cat, she shows, indeed, none of
the endearments of a civilised woman, but quietly concedes
and demands concessions very much as when a
horse and some cows are sheltering from the heat together
in a limited shade.</p>

<p>She speaks hardly ever, except with animals. But in
church her lips move long after others are tired of “have
mercy upon us.”</p>

<p>“Lord!” she says, “you are very kind, but your
children are very many. All the sparrows in my garden
have to be tended, and I suppose the mice, the moles, the
worms, the lizards, the shining things that run and fly
and crawl, and all the flowers, trees and birds. Oh!
Lord, I had seventeen children and among so many you
seemed not to notice some, and they died just anyhow in
their happiness, and perhaps then you have forgotten me
altogether, and I shall not even be taken away. I have
heard that the good shall prosper. You have said it
yourself. But I know not what is good or what is prosperity.
For what am I? I am willing to learn, yet I
am not taught. Am I good? Am I prospering? Lord!
what am I to do? There are thousands and thousands
of strong and rich and beautiful and happy things in
the world, but as for me, I seem to crawl about among
them in darkness like a mole. Nevertheless, glory to God
the father, Lord of all, though you have done some things
that I would not have done, and as to the weather ... but
I know not your designs. Glory to the Son though
he has long been dead, he was a good man. Glory to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Holy Ghost, which I do believe in, though they say there
are no ghosts really. I am a poor old woman, born in
Scotland, and a Scotswoman still. My name is Margaret
Helen Page, and I live at the Hoath Cottage in the wood,
at the end of the lane, where you turn up by ‘The Blue
Anchor,’ in going to Horsmonden. There I shall abide
and am to be found there, except on Sunday evening in
fine weather, when I come to this holy place. Oh, come,
Lord, when you have looked after all the sparrows, some
day, and take me.”</p>

<p>“If,” she said once, “if God’s a Christian man, I do
not know what he means by this weather.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he manages about as well as could be
expected in such a funny world,” replied her husband.
“Remember old Farmer King who used to swear at the
weather so. One day when he had got his hay dry at
last and saw it coming on to rain, he picks up a handful
and stuffs it into his pocket, and says he will carry that
much home dry at any rate, but if he didn’t fall into the
brook on his way back and get wet to the skin. Such are
the ways of God.”</p>

<p>But she was not convinced, for, with all her feebleness
of body and conversation, she proves that man is older
than Christ and Buddha, than Jehovah and Jupiter, and
that not even such presences on the earth have left behind
footpaths in which he can wander in security. She compels
us to realise, if we have not done so before, that if
we could isolate the child of Christian parents on a solitary
island away from all religious influences, he would grow
into something curiously different from a Christian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
something marvellously ancient too. Her language,
stripped of its tattered and scanty Christianisms, and her
acts, without that Sunday journey, reveal the multitude’s
eternal paganism, which religions ruffle and sink into
again&mdash;the paganism of the long-lived, most helpless,
proudest and loneliest of animals, contending with winter
and bad weather, with accident and disease and strange
fears; rejoicing in fine weather, in strength, in the appetites;
hating decay; distrusting the inhumanity of the
heavens and animals and men from other climates; uncertain,
troubled, and thinking little, about the future. For
her the world is a flat place, decorated with a pattern of
familiar and other fields, with hills, rivers, houses, a sea, a
London, a Highland valley of children and old-fashioned
ways, and infinitely far off towards the sunset, lands of
tigers, monkeys, snakes, strange trees and flowers and men,
with earthquakes, volcanoes, huge storms, all lit by sun
and moon and stars&mdash;and a heaven also and a hell. Very
real to her is the snow and the thaw-drip from the roof,
the dry heat of summer, the apple blossom, the coming of
the swallows, the growth of carrots, potatoes, cabbages
and weeds, the coming home of her husband sober or
drunk, the use of a few silver coins week by week, the
announcement that old Mrs. Fuller is dead or that Mrs.
Rixon has another child, the cold at four o’clock on a
January morning and the warmth all night in July as she
sits sleeping, because of her doubled back, like the corpse
of a caveman in his grave, the endlessness of days when
she is alone and has nothing to do but to remember and
try to remember. She has no hopes, no purposes. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
have seen her picking up oak branches in May after the
fall of the great trees, and she will go on after her arms
are filled, adding to the pile from above, and at the same
time losing others from the sides, until at last it is dark
and she goes home. Even so she does in life, accumulating
memories and affairs, and letting them fall, until the
end. Yet it is a little hard that there should be no
kindly god or goddess to deceive her and receive her
prayers and sanctify her little unnecessary acts, that the
very wood at night, round about the house, is merely
dark and full of sounds and no home for her. The
beautiful Jewish stories told to her by clergymen of some
birth and education, though she will gladly listen to them,
are little better than ribands for oak faggots&mdash;for, though
a Pagan, she has no gods. The gods of this part of the
earth have long been hurled into Tartarus and bolted
there in that grotesque company which the prophets of
the ages have gathered together. And so she goes through
life, like a child in a many-windowed house, looking on
sea and barren land, and full of corridors, resounding and
silent by hours, with dim, enormous apartments, bolted
doors, and here and there a picture, a skeleton, an old toy,
a reminiscent voice....</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Compared with Margaret Helen Page, her husband,
Robert, is a citizen of the world. He knows all the
farmers in the neighbourhood, thatching for one, haymaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
for another, gardening, woodcutting, washing or
pole-pulling in the hop-garden for others. He can even
make the beautiful, five-barred gates, with their noble top
bars, tapered and shaped like a gun-stock and barrel. All
the inns are known to him, and the labourers and wayfaring
men who resort to them. He will gossip, and the rich
do not disdain to listen to the fabrications and selections
which he mixes charmingly for them alone. The workhouse
or death is not more than a few years ahead of him,
for he stoops with difficulty and will make haste for no
man; yet he will cheerfully quarrel with a farmer in the
middle of the winter, pick up his coat, take his wages and
go off to the inn and drink all that he has; if the farmer
grumbles in September that Robert has been taking
merely an honest bushel of hops from the pickers he will
not give way to the extent of a handful. No one can
thatch as he can. His tall haystacks look like churches
when they are new, and so they remain. The roofs of
his cornricks are shaped like breasts, with convex curves
that make the same lines against the sky as you walk
round. His vegetable plots are invariably as flat as lawns,
their sides evenly sloping to the paths. He stops in the
midst of his work and smokes and thinks; and he expects
to be paid for his thinking. In the spring he catches
moles, hanging them up on the briers or thorns with
great care, twisting the twigs round them so that they
stay until fur and bone are indistinguishable and break up
into dust.</p>

<p>At the inns he hears the gossip of the universe, heaping
up as in a marine store the details of murders, swindles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
divorces, expensive pictures of Venus, etc., horse races,
cricket matches, letters from archbishops and literary men,
distant wars, new foods and diseases and cures, automobiles,
the cost of rich men’s dinners, how to live happily, the
extravagance of the poor, how to feed on a shilling a week.
These things are “in print” and therefore true. But
he utters no opinion of his own. He consents to exchange
his recollections and to accept others; then he sinks into
the happy silence of those who have not the gift of
ratiocination. What dark, undisturbed depths of personality
are his&mdash;immense depths yielding to the upper world,
now and then, an ejaculation, as Gilbert White’s well
yielded a black lizard at times.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he ejaculated once, “I wonder what God
did with himself before he made such a kettle of fish as
this world.”</p>

<p>Again, “Now supposing that all these things in the
Bible about Adam and the beginning had never been
written down, and we had not been told that God did it,
what should we have done? Should we have found out
these things for ourselves?”</p>

<p>Once he related a <span class="lock">dream:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes when I am all alone, and my old girl says
the same, it seems to me that I am not of much account; it
is as if I had been forgotten and left off the register, and
how will it be at the Judgment Day? Sometimes I think
to myself, It will be fine sleeping and never hearing the
blessed trumpet and getting into that crowd. But one
night I dreamed that I had died and was up above, and
that an angel woke me up and asked me to take his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
trumpet, because he wanted a bit of sleeping after waiting
ever since Adam’s time, and I was to blow it at twelve
o’clock and then it would be Judgment Day. Well, as
he looked like a gentleman, I said I would and I took the
trumpet and stared at it a bit, because it was that trumpet
that was to wake the dead for the Judgment Day. I
was wide awake and I could see the dead all round me,
more of them than there are mangolds in twenty acres.
Close to me were the angels, and they were all asleep,
worn out with waiting so long, I suppose. They had
wings like peacocks and owls and orpingtons&mdash;beautiful!
I enjoyed myself. But when it got near to twelve o’clock
I got a bit anxious. The angel was fast asleep and I did
not see why I should wake him up, or anybody else.
Once or twice I put the trumpet to my lips, but I thought&mdash;No,
I would sleep myself and there would be no
Judgment Day. But I could not sleep for thinking of
the keeper who used to kill my old girl’s cats as fast as
they grew up and went into the woods at night; and,
without thinking what I was at, I blew the trumpet
and what with the terrible noise and the sight of all
these poor people waking up I awoke myself and my
old girl said that I had made a noise like a trumpet
in my sleep. But it did seem a pity that they should
all wake up just as if they had to go to ploughing and all
that again.”</p>

<p>But Bacchus is his only god, who has already given him
many gifts. On Friday nights he is as a child upon the
throne, holding himself wonderfully straight on the settle
at the inn, never letting go of the tankard except to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
it filled, and smiling delicately with weary eyes, as he
drinks the six <span class="lock">ale&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Much more of price and of more gratious powre</div>
       <div class="verse">In this, then that same water of Ardenne,</div>

<p>At such times he speaks little, except a few words of
nonsense to strangers who come in; but he smiles continually,
as if he had forgiven all things, and even as if
he silently preached forgiveness to all the world. His
tenderness to children and animals is wonderful. He
would pass as a saint, an angelic doctor, or even something
higher. To some, indeed, he might seem to be the
original from which field artists have everywhere
modelled the scarecrow. The young men recognise the
resemblance and smile. The older men perhaps see in
him an apotheosis of themselves, more twisted, more
starved, greener in the hat and coat, and they do not
smile. He has a lean, acorn-coloured face, adorned with
relenting blue eyes, small hawk nose, clear-cut shrivelled
lips and chin, and fresh brown hair hanging like a lion
skin over his head and neck, and curling sumptuously.</p>

<p>I can fancy him a lesser god in some mythology. To
him come the weak and ashamed; the shamefaced female
tramp who went hungry, having asked for a direction to
Maidstone instead of for food, because the farmer’s voice
was hard and he was young and strong and her skirt was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
old and her breast shrunken; and he who looked through
the hedge at some fair children playing and then, because
one of them screamed at catching sight of him in
searching for a nest, raised a hideous cry and sent them
terrified away; the curst, scandalous lean maid who melts
with momentary tenderness over her starved and piebald
cat, and calls him “Prettiest”; all such as are foolish and
slow of thought and slower of speech, and laugh at what
they love because others do and then weep in solitude;
those who, unable to care for anything much, grow
ardent in a simulated affection and blush when a cruel
strong one finds them out; those who know not what
they desire except a little tranquillity before the end and
know that they shall not obtain it; the drunken and
obscene who are without graces, but also without repentance;
those who vainly complain and fret about the
evils which they have deserved and cannot endure; those
who cannot keep up with life because of one beautiful or
terrible thing in the past; those who mourn, they know
not why; the little base ones who admire good and lovely
things, and fear to hurt them by approval. And they
should come to this god, Robert, as one in whom each
saw his little unknown virtue and should be lifted up
thereat. They should bring to his altars sour bread and
rotten flesh and fruit fallen before its time, and worn-out,
shattered things; and his priests, leprous, and scrofulous,
and squint-eyed all, should rejoice then and tell the
worshippers to be no more cast down, because in this,
their god, were to be found all their little virtues, and
behold! he endured for ever and looked upon them
pitifully and interceded continually with the high gods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Then would they drink until they were thoroughly
drunken, and the god would tell them that death came
soon, and that their sleep would be heavier than they
could dream of, for no king, or judge, or policeman, or
clergyman, could ever disturb their sleep, though armed
with sharpest swords and most cruel words.</p>

<span class="smaller">NOVEMBER RAIN</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Close, perpendicular, quiet rain came upon me when I
was ten miles from last night’s shelter and ten miles from
my end. Shelter was not near, nor indeed to be thought
of in an untrodden lane which had been, for some time,
and seemed to go on for ever, winding through the
delicious, vacant country of a late autumn Sunday, while
it was yet early in the day and yet not so early but that
the milking was over, and the milk carts gone, and the
cattle satisfied and slow after their first questing in the
fields. The rain was so dense, and the light so restrained,
and the drops hung so about my eyes, and the sound and
the sweetness of it made my brain so well contented with
all that umber country asleep, that what I saw was little
compared with what reached me by touch and by darker
channels still. I rarely see much in the country&mdash;a few
herbs underfoot, the next field, the horizon woods, some
brief light that shows only its departing hem; for, like
others, I always carry out into the fields a vast baggage
of prejudices from books and strong characters whom I
have met. My going forth, although simple enough to
the eye, is truly as pompous as that of a rajah who goes
through the jungle on a tall and richly encrusted elephant,
with a great retinue, and much ceremony and noise. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
he frightens bird and beast, and tramples on herb and
grass, so I scatter from my path many things which are
lying in wait for a discoverer. There is no elephant
more heavy-footed and no rifle more shattering than the
egoism of an imitative brain. And thus the little thing I
saw was an unusual discovery.</p>

<p>It was a triangular, six-acre wood below me, across a
bare and soaking ploughland. The wood was mainly of
ash and the myriad stems were a grey mist, only denser
and a little clearer than the rain itself. Out of them
rose half a hundred oaks which were exuberant in foliage
of hues so vigorous and splendid in their purple that it
was impossible to think of it as on the edge of death, but
easy to think of it as in a deathless prime. One thrush
sang heartily somewhere deep among the ash trees, and
that was the only sound, for the sound of the rain was
but a carpet on which that song walked forth, delicate
footed, haughty and beautiful....</p>

<p>When I had walked another mile, the wood was out of
sight, the thrush unheard. The wood is now purple
immortally, for ever that song emerges from its heart, as
free from change as one whom we remember vividly in
the tip-toe of his exulting youth, and dying then has
escaped huskiness, and a stoop, and foul breath, and a
steady view of life.</p>



<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span class="smaller">JANUARY SUNSHINE</span></h3>
</div>


<p>It is a quiet valley in which moist fields of meadow,
mowing grass, mangold, and stubble are bounded from one
another by deep ditches and good hedges of maple, thorn
and hazel, with here and there an oak, or by oak woods
that rise above an undergrowth of grey ash. Every half
mile there is a tiled farmhouse with low-pitched roof and
low, square windows, their frames painted white, and
between them rose trees climbing; in the gardens of
most, two plots of lawn are surrounded by rich dark
borders and divided by a path; and each has a careless
shrubbery of Portuguese laurel, lilac, syringa and elder,
hardly cut off from the orchard that grows as it will
above grey rank grass, and close by at least two ponds.
One little stream winds through the valley and gains at
times much glory of speed and sound and foam from the
rain off the hillside. A few grey, smooth roads cross the
valley.</p>

<p>It is January, and the predominant grass is green and
shining in the sun. The rusty oaks and the farmhouse
roofs glow. The bare clean hedges glitter with all their
stems of olive hazel, silver oak and ash and white thorn,
and blackthorn ruddy where the cattle have rubbed. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
lark rises and sings. A flock of linnets scatters and drops
little notes like a rain of singing dew, and over all is a
high blue sky, across which the west wind sets a fleet of
bright white clouds to sail; into this blue sky the woods
of the horizon drive their black teeth.</p>

<p>In the immense crystal spaces of fine windy air thus
bounded by blue sky, black woods and green grass, the
jackdaws play. They soar, they float, they dance, and
they dive and carve sudden magnificent precipices in the
air, crying all the time with sharp joyous cries that are in
harmony with the great heights and dashing wind. The
carter’s boy raises his head from the furrow and shouts to
them now and then, while the brass furnishings of his
horses gleam, their shoulders grow proud and their black
tails stream out above the blue furrow and the silver
plough.</p>

<p>Suddenly a pheasant is hurled out of a neighbouring
copse; something crosses the road; and out over a
large and shining meadow goes a fox, tall and red,
going easily as if he sailed in the wind. He crosses
that meadow, then another, and he is half a mile away
before a loud halloo sounds in the third field, and a mile
away before the first hound crosses the road upon his
scent.</p>

<p>Run hard hounds, and drown the jackdaws’ calling
with your concerted voices. It is good to see your long
swift train across the meadow and away, away; on such
a day a man would give everything to run like that.
Run hard, fox, and may you escape, for it would not be
well to die on such a day, unless you could perchance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
first set your fair teeth into the throats of the foolish ones
who now break through the hedge on great horses and
pursue you&mdash;I know not why&mdash;ignorant of the command
that has gone forth from the heart of this high blue
heaven, Be beautiful and enjoy and live!</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<span class="smaller">THE BARGE</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Spring and summer and autumn had come&mdash;flowing
into one another with that secrecy which, as in the
periods of our life, spares us the pain of the irretraceable
step&mdash;and still a golden tree stood here and there in the
hollowed lawns.... Snow fell on singing thrushes and
golden trees, and when it was over a half moon of
untouched grass under a dense hawthorn was as a green
shadow on the white land.... Then the year paused;
there was a swallow still here and there; but again there
was snow....</p>

<p>The world had been black and white for many days.
The cygnet-coloured sky had been low from dawn to
sunset; rarely a cloud dimly appeared in it, seen and lost
and seen again, like a slow fish in rippling water. By
night the iron firmament had been immense and remote.</p>

<p>Out of doors, as we walked, it was a source of faint
satisfaction that we were clothed and fed; and it was
easy to think of a less happy condition. We were in a
primitive world. In those short days the world seemed
to have grown larger; distance was more terrible. A
friend living thirty miles off seemed inaccessible in the
snow. The earth had to be explored, discovered, and
mapped again; it was as it had been centuries ago, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
progress was not very real to our minds. Only when we
saw a great fire at an inn, a red face or two, a copper
vessel thrust in among the coals to warm the ale, did
there appear to be much being done to fight winter
and to subjugate this primitive world. We saw the birds
around us for what they were&mdash;little, tender, hungry
things, entirely sorrowful, easily killed, and not mere
melodious attendants upon our delight.</p>

<p>A train crawling along the valley at a distance was
very feeble in our eyes. The strength and purpose were
concerted. It was like a thought which is without the
implements for action&mdash;pathetic and impotent, it was
absorbed easily by the vast white land. It shrieked and
was lost in a tunnel.</p>

<p>There were only two real things&mdash;the cold and the
thought of man. The cold expressed itself easily by
the whiteness and the leaden shade, the great power of
distance, the obliteration of colours, footpaths, landmarks,
the silence. Thought was not equally vigorous. It could
not sustain itself alone. Men had to walk hard, to talk
and even then to change the subjects rapidly, especially if
they were abstract. Thus to compare the ham of Wiltshire
with that of South Wales was pleasant and easy for
a time; but to discuss the nature of love or style or virtue
was not long possible.</p>

<p>Under the ice of a pond lay the last summer’s nest of
a grebe among the rotten reeds. High and low in the
hedges, old nests were as the jetsam of summer’s wreck&mdash;as
if a galleon should be represented by a boot on the
shore.</p>

<p>Through the land went a dusky river, and in it a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
barge with merrily painted prow. It was guided by a
brown woman wearing a yellow scarf and she stood
boldly up. In the midst of it a man played on a concertina
and sang. The barge was light and high in the
water; lonely and unnoticed, it threaded the long curves
and still the concertina lamented and the tall woman
stood boldly up. As it disappeared the dolorous air
began to darken and I knew why that barge stood so high
and light&mdash;because its cargo was merely all the flowers
and the birds and the joys and pains of spring, the contentments
of summer, the regrets of autumn, of all
men and women who had lived through the now dying
year; and no one claimed them, no one sought them, no
one stood on the bank to salute them.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<span class="smaller">A WINTER MORNING</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Night was soon to pass into a winter day as I looked
out of the window to see what kind of a world it was
that had been, since I began to read, shutting me off
effectually from everything but my book.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“And but the flitter-winged verse must tell,</div>
       <div class="verse">For truth’s sake, what woe afterwards befell,</div>
       <div class="verse">’Twould humour many a heart to leave them thus,</div>
       <div class="verse">Shut from the busy world of more incredulous.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The words were still fresh in my brain.</p>

<p>But, outside, the trees and barns and shed were quiet
and dim, and as much submerged and hidden from the
air in which I had been living as the green streets of
motionless lily and weed at the bottom of some lonely
pool where carp and tench go slowly. The road went
straight away from the window to the invisible beyond;
hard and dry, it was trying to shine, as if it recalled the
sunlight. Half way along, at one side, under a broad
oak, there was a formless but pregnant shadow. The
farm buildings that lay about the road were huddled,
dark, colourless and indistinguishable because of their
shadows; they might have been heaped up by a great
plough, of which the road was the shining furrow; they
were not so much the vague wreckage of what I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
known yesterday, as a chaos out of which perhaps something
was to be born. Yet the outside world was vaster
than it had seemed when I could see three ranges of hills
and guess at the sea beyond; and strange it was when the
<span class="lock">words&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“She saw the young Corinthian Lycius</div>
       <div class="verse">Charioting foremost in the envious race</div>
       <div class="verse">Like a young love, with calm, uneager face,</div>
       <div class="verse">And fell into a swooning love of him”&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>came back to me. How frail and perilous and small was
the poet’s shielded world! The outside world threatened
it as the smooth escarpment of tall, toppling water
threatens the little piping sea-bird. And yet this poet’s
world was for the time being my life. Beyond his words
there were, perhaps, the gay, the dear, the beautiful
persons whom I knew; Nobby, the tinker, and many
more; but probably they slept; they were vain if they
were not fictitious; if they could be supposed to live, my
only proof of it was that somehow they were connected
with a very distant light that refused to go out among
the westward copses. They were hardly more credible
than the words of a stale preacher talking of charity, or
an artful poet writing of love.</p>

<p>So I clung to Keats, the reality, until the road grew
almost white, and under that broad oak some rational,
nay, beautiful outlines begin to appear, which the shadow
enveloped like a cocoon. The outlines were hardly built
until they were seen to be a waggon, and its birth out of
the shadow was a mighty thing that shared the idiom of
stately trees and the motions of great waters and of cliffs
that look on sunset and a noble sea. Dimly, uncertainly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
powerfully, never quite expressing itself in any known
language&mdash;as was natural in what seemed to belong to an
early brood of the giant earth&mdash;the waggon emerged, with
ponderous wheels and slender, curving timbers and trailing
shafts. The chariot of Dis coming up to Persephone
looked thus majestic. Yet the waggon suggested nothing
definite, at least no history. It had no such articulate
power. But antiquity played about it as, an hour before,
it had played about my shelves and books. It was simply
the richer for its long life, like a violin or a wise man;
and, like them, it neither carried its legend on its exterior
nor encouraged anything more than joyful surmise.</p>

<p>It was the one clearly visible piece of man’s work
among all those potent shadows and uncertain forms of
roof and wall; it was crowned by the last stars. Becoming
clearer as morning came, it was an important
part of the recreation of the world, and involved in it,
just as a brazen image may seem to be part of the good
fortune or calamity which follows prayer to it. It filled
the white road with emotion. It was more intelligible
than some men are when they say “I worship” or “I
love.” Keats left my mind. From my memory, I added
melodies of voice and harp and reed, and noise of seas
and winds in forests and houses by night, and organ
music, with its many demons blithe and terrible, exploring
the skiey roof of some cathedral and knocking at the
clerestory to get out, floating, sad or happy, about the
aisles, and settling at last to make the old purples and
greens and blues in the glass more solemn than before;
and yet I could not reproduce the melody or anything
like it, with which the old waggon pervaded the farmyard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Slowly the light came, and the world was filled
with it as imperceptibly as the brain with a great thought.
It fell upon the spokes of the waggon wheel, and they
seemed to move. Then all was over.</p>

<p>The clear face of things which it is so hard to enjoy
was back again. The determined starlings flew swift
and straight overhead. The clouds about the risen sun
went stately upon their errands through the sky.</p>

<span class="smaller">CHERRY BLOSSOM</span></h3>
</div>


<p>In front, a tall beechen hill closes up the gulf that runs
out of the valley into the heart of the chalk down. The
hill fills nearly half the sky, and just above it stands the
white full moon, as one who looks over his lands. It
warms the low, pale, curdled sky, but does not disturb
the darkness of the beeches. All its light seems to fall
and settle, as if it would dwell there for ever in the cherry
trees on either hand. All are blossoming, and in their
branches the nightingales sing out of the blossom, dispersing
what ruins remain of the world of yesterday, and
building rapidly those tall watch towers that last until
dawn, which men may climb and from their summits see
what may make them out of love with the earth.</p>

<p>The past day is long past, the day of fighting, digging,
buying, selling, writing; and if there are still men on the
earth they are all equal in the trances of passion or sleep;
the day to come is not to be thought of. The moon
reigns; you rule. The centuries are gathered up in
your hand. You and the moonlight and the nightingale
and the cherry blossom have your own way with them
all night long. It is true then that Virgil, Catullus,
Crashaw, Burton, Shelley ... live still, and Horace,
Racine, Bishop Beveridge ... never lived. You exult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
because you are alive and your spirit possesses this broad,
domed earth. Poor thing as you are, you have somehow
gained a power of expression like the nightingale’s, a pure
translucency like the petals of the flowers; and as never
before to man or woman you open your eyes widely and
frankly, even the limbs move with the carelessness of the
animals, the features lose the rigidity that comes of
compromise and suppression.</p>

<p>Walking slowly thus, with a bowed head, you find an
image of yourself and the universe in a shallow pool
among the trees. The pool is your own mind. The
flowers at its edge&mdash;hyacinth, primrose, marsh-marigold,
and all the trees and their foliage&mdash;are the intimate and
permanent companions of your life, and they are clearly
mirrored in the water. An oak draws a long, snaky
shadow from side to side, with the head and neck of a
sitting dove among the leaves. And there, too, are the
stars and the moon, brought down into that homely company
of trees and flowers by the shining water, and
preserved there in strangely woven patterns; just as in
your mind you mingle visions of the world, the past, the
imaginary, with your own domestic surroundings and
acts, and a changing mood, like a puff of wind across the
pool, erases them. How sovereign and proud your own
form plunged among these mirrored stars and leaves!
On such a night an uncourageous lover, who sat at the
edge with his mistress, was lured to a strange boldness by
long gazing at the two blissful figures down there among
the clouds. “See how fair they are,” he said, “and how
happy and close. Let us make them kiss.” And the
shadows kissed in the bosom of the pool.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FOX HUNT</span></h3>
</div>


<p>We had driven ten miles through a country that rose
and fell with large, stormy lines of hillock and hill. A
March sun was bright, but a sharpness lingered in the air
from last night’s frost, like a cold spring in a warm lake.
Over the hazy, genial oak woods on the hills sailed slow
white gulls all crying, “wheel whill” with a shrillness
that suited the high blue sky. Sowers went across the
long red fields, casting dark seeds that flew in curved
clouds before them at each second step and vanished in
the wind. On the steep roads the dust whirled in curves
as of perfect dancers, which the kestrel repeated on a
grand scale high overhead. Thrushes sang at ash tops
and in hedges. And we four talked, making such harmonious
music to a fine day as men may, with jest and
recollection and anticipation of the meet of the fox
hounds to which we were going, two to ride and two to
follow afoot.</p>

<p>Within a mile of the meet we got down at a farmhouse,
where the horses were awaiting their owners and
the yeoman was to join us.</p>

<p>The farm-buildings made almost a complete quadrangle
with the side of the house&mdash;stables, cow stalls, a granary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of ancient stone, a barn with a low-arched Tudor doorway
like a broad back ready to receive a weight, and
ladders and lengths of oak leaning against the walls.
There stood the horses, nodding by their grooms, with
restless fetlocks; a red calf flung up its heels amongst the
flying, yellow straw; the fowls were stately and fluttered
by turns. The house was all white, except for the roof
of stone “slats” and the large dark windows. Close to
it, away from the farm buildings, lay the crooked orchard.
We passed through the shrubbery, without offending its
warbling blackbirds, and across a lawn to the door.</p>

<p>The yeoman was of a noble, antique type; of medium
height; straight, but mobile, and stooping gently as
he listened, with moderate, neat, large-featured head;
reticent, slow but beautiful of speech, ready with laughter.
He made me think of the last Roman who spoke the
speech of Virgil and Cæsar quite pure. He was in his
prime, past thirty, the last of his family, and still holding
their few hundred acres, a bachelor who had not long
since won his captivity from the pale, fair-haired beauty
at his side, to judge by her commanding smiles from time
to time.</p>

<p>They were sure of a fox, he said; not so sure to kill,
because the ground was dry again in spite of last night’s
frost, and scent bad.</p>

<p>As we stood round the room eating sandwiches&mdash;there
was yet half an hour before the meet&mdash;one asked him if
he knew anything of an old house in a valley some miles
away. All the doors and walls were panelled with
mirrors amidst their bright oak, and as you sat there you
saw your party repeated as if through the walls in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
neighbouring rooms. He had not time to answer when
an old bent and pallid man, his uncle, who had sat unobserved,
began to speak in a feeble, singing voice, strangely
laughing at times.</p>

<p>“I know the house with the mirrors. The Merediths
lived there for three hundred years, and I knew the last
of them well. She was Arabella. She had no brothers,
and there is no child. I was a young man then, and
though you may not easily believe it, when you see this
arm, I was a fine, strong man. Ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p>He stopped to chuckle abstractedly, with ambiguous
irony at the contrast between his early lustihood and the
decrepitude which had coffined it. Perhaps his nephew
winced at the garrulity and such irony as the thick
laughter disclosed to him, but he did nothing to divert
the talk, nor did Enid, his betrothed, when she filled a
glass with whisky and water for the old man, who did
but admire it with a sudden satisfaction, and then <span class="lock">continued:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Well, I was about the age of my nephew yonder,
and I had never known what pain or misery was, except
when I was nearly beaten by a gipsy in running down
Mowland Hill. I farmed and I hunted, and it was
understood that I was to marry an amiable and pretty
young woman whom my father admired so much that he
was willing that nobody should be my wife if not she.
But I was in no haste, and indeed I was not fond of
women. Others I knew seemed stupid or frivolous.
This one was chiefly busy with the church and the poor.
I respected her, and I believe now that she would have
looked after me well in my old age. She understood me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
we had known one another since we were children, and
I used to delight to stop my horse to speak to her on a
fine day when I was feeling fresh and gay. At last it was
agreed that we were soon to be married, and I did not
know why to draw back.”</p>

<p>Enid glanced quickly at my host, all the command
having left her meek smile, and as quickly dropped her
eyes. It seemed to me that the glance betrayed a
slender fear or anticipation which she was ashamed of
immediately. By his over-rigid tranquillity it may be
that her lover gave a similar sign, the only one, and lost
on her.</p>

<p>“No,”&mdash;the old man paused, as though he would still
have liked to unearth some excuse which he might, fifty
years back, have made for breaking his troth. “No,” he
said, questioningly, “I did not know why to draw back.
But one day a woman I had sometimes heard of&mdash;she
had been away at school and with friends almost continually&mdash;came
and joined our hunt for the first time&mdash;Arabella
Meredith. She was over one bank before me,
and I thought that Edith would never have done that.
We had a good day and a long one. As I was riding
back I was pretty well satisfied when with great clatter
Miss Meredith rode up to me. She had had a long day
and she was hot with her gallop, and yet as she came
alongside, I turning my horse so that both curvetted
together in the narrow road, she was as fresh as if it had
been raining and she just out to take the air, as fresh as a
young lime leaf and as clean and, if you understand me,
as inhuman in a way, at least I thought so that evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
when I was alone. When I saw her eyes, as I soon did,
they seemed to belong to somebody else hiding there, and
not the woman I had seen jumping.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Arnold,’ she said, ‘I hear you are to be married....’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I said.</p>

<p>“‘Then you will marry me,’ she said.</p>

<p>“In a mazy way I said that I would think about it, and
she replied instantly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘Please ride as far as our house with me&mdash;not but
that I can look after myself, though it is fifteen miles
away, and the roads bad and dark&mdash;and you will have
plenty of time to think about it.’</p>

<p>“I rode home with her, and I did not think at all, and
I did not speak; nor did she, except to the horse; and
at the end I said that I would marry her if she were
willing.</p>

<p>“‘I will think about it,’ she said, ‘good-night,’ and I
turned my horse to do the ten miles that divided the
house with the mirrors from this. It was an extraordinary
thing to do, I think. The next day I told Edith that I
could not marry her because I wanted to marry Miss
Meredith. There was trouble, but it is a long time ago.
Edith never married, but continued to help the church
and the poor in another part of the country. She was a
good woman.”</p>

<p>Enid had flushed&mdash;was it angrily?&mdash;at the first mention
of Arabella. She was become serious and very still, and
looked no more at her neighbour who was apparently
studying some drawings of spaniels. Seeing the gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
girl’s pain I was sorry that I had not helped her in the
attempt to check the old man. But that was impossible
now.</p>

<p>“Arabella was wonderful,” he exclaimed, his old voice
slowing to a stronger tone and a new solemnity. “Arabella
was wonderful. I believed then that for a man to
live as I had lived for so long, and then to see her all
suddenly, was the best thing in the world. I used to
look at her, and even when I did not see her face, but
only her neck and hair and dress and feet, it was just like&mdash;like
it used to be looking up on a day like this at the
blossoming tops of tall elms right in the sky, and hearing
the cuckoo’s mate up there.</p>

<p>“Twice a week I used to walk over to her house or to
some place near by to see her. I don’t know which was
best&mdash;the fine weather or the wet&mdash;when I went, for in
the rain I used to shut out the noise of the rain with my
singing all kinds of songs, and sometimes I used to run
and whoop as if the hounds had just killed a fox. It was
a long way to walk, and sometimes, especially at night, I
used to go almost mad with thinking of all the dense
space and time and other people, intervening between her
and me. Yet I always refused to ride if a farmer stopped
his cart, and took footpaths to avoid them. The train
to London which I saw all bright on winter evenings
used to give me an odd joy and envy&mdash;thinking of all
those unknown people as if they were hurrying faster than
I to see their sweethearts. I did think her beautiful.
When I saw Edith in those days, it was somehow painful,
like seeing a lamb lying aside dead in a ditch.”</p>

<p>Enid had turned her face away to the window and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
lawn. Just so pitiful might she seem were she passed
over by her lover.</p>

<p>“I am not going to tell you,” the old lover went on,
looking at nothing visible, “what we did when we met.
I think sometimes now that we were not wise. But we
used to walk and walk, and she would tell me about girls
and the ways of girls, and her childhood, so that I wished
I had been a boy with her. She would praise me and say
that if ever anything happened to me so that I was hurt
and maimed, or if I should die, she would not go on
living. The thought of such a thing made her angry
and she would stop, and, without looking at me and
seeming to forget me, would lift her arms and say confused
things that sounded fierce which I could not hear,
and then suddenly turn to me quite happy again.</p>

<p>“It was the finest day in my life, when, one May day
we fished together, and cooked some fresh caught trout
by the riverside over a fire of oak branches, and ate them
together in the morning, just as the sun grew hot.</p>

<p>“Every day I wished to marry her, especially when
she spoke suddenly after being silent, or when I could
only smell her lovely breath and see the pale skin under
her little ear in the dark.</p>

<p>“She did extraordinary things and she made me do
extraordinary things.</p>

<p>“One day as we were walking we heard the sound of
the Fair, and Arabella said that we must go. As quick
as thought she knocked some walnuts off a tree and we
stained our faces with the juice of the rind, and at a
friendly cottage borrowed a rude disguise, for we went as
gipsies. Arabella told fortunes, first, and I had to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
some too. Then she wanted me to play on a flute while
she danced; but instead I kept somewhere near while
she danced, to see that all was as it should be; and as it
was, I nearly had to knock down a little Welshman
whose harp she began dancing to; for while he played
and she danced I hardly knew what was happening; it
was as if I had gone into a church with rich windows
out of a dark night. She danced all the way home,
sometimes with her right hand just touching my right
shoulder and looking up at me&mdash;Ah! Perhaps she thought
I was a little careless at seeing her as much in love with
me as I with her, and suddenly taking her hand off my
shoulder she said quite fiercely that I must do something
to show that I would do anything for her.”</p>

<p>Here the old man stopped and laughed and drank his
whisky and seemed disinclined to go on. The yeoman
rose hastily and we had to follow at once, all but Enid,
the old man and the boldest and worst horseman who
was taking some more “jumping powder” with an air;
and then, when all had mounted in the farmyard, I found
courage to equal my curiosity and asked the yeoman for
the end of the story. He stopped his impatient horse
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“One night in November, when the river was in flood,
my uncle remembered what Miss Meredith had said, and
in his clothes he swam over instead of going round by the
bridge. It was a long and difficult swim and he got
bruised on the rocks; but he got through and then went
to meet Miss Meredith. I do not know what happened
that evening, but the next day his life was in danger from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
fever, and for many days he was ill. As soon as she
heard, Miss Meredith came over and saw him when he
was at his worst; I think someone told her that he
would recover, being so vigorous a man. Some days later
they picked her out of the river, and they say she had
drowned herself. My uncle says that as he lay ill he
was proud, and did not even ask for Miss Meredith lest
she should see him as he was. But when he got downstairs
and felt well and was growing stronger, they told
him that she was buried in Mowland churchyard. Then
he laughed terribly with long laughs, so that they say my
grandmother heard him in London, and went on laughing
at the magnificent jest of that beautiful woman being
underground.</p>

<p>“She was small, with fair skin and brown hair that was
pure gold where it was rolled up behind her ear, and she
had a deep clear voice. Her skill in dancing was great,
and as a rider only my uncle excelled her. She was
generous and tender, but courageous and unforgiving,
never losing either friend or enemy.</p>

<p>“He has quite recovered now. It is wonderful what
things a man will recover from. He does not mind telling
the story; I think he is even a little ashamed of his infatuation.
All the women who were born in that house,
at least all the Merediths, are said to have been odd, and
they were all beautiful.”</p>

<p>“It is well for all of us,” said one, “that there are not
many Arabellas in the world.”</p>

<p>“There are not many,” said the yeoman; and he was
about to follow the rest when I saw Enid, a little anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and it may have been apologetic, at the door. “Good-bye,
Arabella,” he called, with quiet raillery.</p>

<p>“No!” she stamped her foot impatiently, but gently
even so. He kissed her hand and looked at her; and as
he rode away, I saw that she was at peace again. He
shouted that they would see us by the gorse.</p>

<p>And so those three rode away and we walked to the
meet. All the labourers on the farm where the hounds
met had a holiday, and all the children too, enough of
them to drown the music of the hounds. There were
about twenty men and women riding, three in pink, two
or three rich men and as many rich women, a lawyer, a
doctor and many farmers and their boys; and everyone
talked with everyone. They found a fox in the long,
tumbling hill of gorse that ran almost to the river’s edge;
but the scent was bad, and after running backwards and
forwards for some time, they drew several little covers
and there were some rapid bursts with merry music, and
flying of dust on the ploughland and halloos here and
there, and laughter and chatter of boys, and slow comment
from the labourers. But soon all was quiet except
that a child was telling a blind farmer where the hounds
were and which way they were going.</p>

<p>The river ran at our feet in one large curve, and among
banks not so steep but that it shone continually. Just
below us the lover must have swum, landing in the tall
oaks that came to the edge. On the farther side a road
went up from the low bridge and over the hill and then, but
out of sight, down to the house with the mirrors. Ten
miles away, above the river, with its church tower against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the sky in a manner that commanded everyone who could
walk, was the little town where they still hold a Michaelmas
Fair. Beyond that, faint and delicate, small and
beautiful as the lines in an oyster shell, were great hills
all but invisible in haze.</p>

<span class="smaller">APPLE BLOSSOM</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The stream going helpless and fast between high banks
is gloomy until it is turned to bright, airy foam and
hanging crystal by the mill; over the restless pool below
hangs a hawthorn all white and fragrant and murmurous
with bloom.</p>

<p>Above the mill, to the north, the land rises in long,
lustrous, melodiously swelling lawns of perfect green to
the dark borders of a beech wood, where the sweet, thick
air fills the hollows among the virginal foliage with blue.
In one place the beeches have parted and made a broad
avenue for the eye to travel towards a noble stone house,
many-angled, many-windowed, grey, discreet, holding, or
on such a day seeming to hold, human life worthy to
walk upon the long lawns to the mill, where now nothing
moves except the divine sunlight and, in the hollows, its
little cloudy elves.</p>

<p>Below the mill, to the south, is a land of tall trees
standing in conclaves of woods, in whispering groups, or
solitary, each in its sovereignty of shade and shining grass;
of apple orchards and farmhouses that lie, amidst their
haystacks and ricks of straw, in gulfs among the trees;
and here and there the yellow skeleton of an oak, encircled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
by its bark and twigs in piles, thrusts its sharp appealing
lines through the neighbouring green.</p>

<p>There is the tall, stony beech, its bole as fair as human
shoulders and flanks, lighted and shadowed changefully,
its topmost branches curving over as if with the weight
of birds alighting, and doves and wood-wrens among the
leaves; the twisted birch’s misty, moving foliage as of a
pensive fountain; the oak, whose dark branches only
yesterday were interwoven like the flight of many bats at
twilight, now an enchanted hill of glowing bronze; the
straight, lean, athletic ash, like a young prince in short
hunting tunic; the calm, feminine sycamore whose fresh
foliage hangs in folds as of smoke; the pollard willow,
along the stream, an ancient, neglected, grotesque deity,
reluctantly assuming its green garlands for yet another
spring.</p>

<p>These things and many more the eye sees delightedly,
and having ranged, finds its chief joy in some narrow
tract of the large land, like the first field below the
mill.</p>

<p>It is but an acre or two of sweet, undulating pasture,
bounded on two sides by tall hawthorn hedges, on the
third by an ash copse, on the other by an orchard of apple
trees. The grass is pure green, revealing here and there
a purple orchis or dog violet or blue self-heal, except
where the crystal brook rushes through it and gathers
white and gold about its banks. Here no shadow falls, or
if it does the dew and blossoms break it up. The leaning
and interwoven apple trees make a white and wine-filled
sky by their dense clots of bloom. The swallows embroider
the air with their songs and their blue flight. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
farmhouse walls are dusky red between the trunks. Overhead,
the dim blue sky lets a white cloud roll out at
intervals like lilies from a pool. And the blackbird
perfects his song indolently; the thrush thinks clearly,
sharply aloud, with nothing long drawn out; and the
willow wren happily complains for ever&mdash;a voice that has
wings and must revolve continually through the land to
express for one or another the vague pains or pleasures of
spring day.</p>

<p>The hedges and the orchard and the copse shut out
everything except that, through the ash stems, there is
the dim, white sea far off, gentle, like a fantastic tale of
men and women that never were, in countries where no
discoverer’s keel has ever shrieked upon the beach, to
which the eye wanders now and then, returning again to
the apple blossom and the grass with an added security.</p>

<p>Over the green grass walks the farmer’s daughter in a
white dress, on her head a mushroom-shaped straw hat
that reveals black hair curving like the wings of a dove
over the half moon of her brow, and like smoke above
her golden nape. She stands still like a straight birch in
heavy snow&mdash;her form and her dress one and yet separate,
and definitely female in rise and fall. She walks like a
summer cloud, except that her feet, clad in shining black,
take firm hold upon the grass and spurn it strongly, yet
with the light short steps of a proud bird. Her left hand
carries purple orchis and white stitchwort, and carefully,
but fantastically and unnecessarily, raises the hem of her
skirt to the height of the tallest dandelions. Her right
hand is free to gather flowers, to feel the growth of the
young greenfinches in the nest, to arrange and disarrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
her hair. Her small round head is lifted up, her eyes
fully round, her lips too much curved to meet very often
yet, her nose clear and straight, and the fair, wing-like
curve of bone from ear to chin seeming to be born of the
shadow which it creates upon her neck. Her childhood
has passed, her maturity has not come. She is a Lady
May, careless, proud, at ease. On her lips, indeed, is a
childish song; but she has become more strange and
distant to children than older women are, for the moment&mdash;perhaps
for to-day only, since to-morrow she may meet
a man and stay late in the lanes. She is as strange as the
silver water that gushes among green grass and marigold
in the copse, or as the blue swallow slanting down the
sunny red wall. To look at her is to take deep breaths
as at the savour of warm bread, of honeysuckle, of cows
when they come from the meadows into a dusty road. A
speech that should be all sapphires and pearls would not
be worthy of her&mdash;to-day. She is at the altar of Aphrodite
“full of pity”&mdash;to-day. She has been carried far in
the goddess’s dove-drawn chariot over mountains and seas,
and has bathed in the same fountain as Aphrodite, nor
yet been seen of men&mdash;to-day. Delay, sun, above the
sea; wait, moon, below the hills; sing, birds; rustle,
new-leaved beeches; for to-morrow and the day after and
for ever until the end this will be but a memory and may
be all she has. She walks hardly faster than the shadows
over the fair grass: and you, Time, O Woodman! set
not your axe at the foot of this tree, lean not upon it with
your strong hands. See! the crest nods and the air
trembles; let it not fall to-day.</p>

<span class="smaller">A LITTLE BEFORE HARVEST</span></h3>
</div>


<p>Summer is perfect now.</p>

<p>The wheat says so, when in the dawn it drips with
half-an-hour’s rain and gleams like copper under the fresh,
dim sky; it cries aloud the same when it crackles in the
midday sun, and the golden sea of it washes murmurously
to the feet of the hills.</p>

<p>In the hedges and fields the agrimony wands and
mullein staves, the climbing vetch, the cushioned bird’s-foot
lotus, the myriads of ragwort and sow thistle, are
golden too.</p>

<p>The meadowsweet and honeysuckle flowers and the
wild carrot seeds give out sweet scents, but not so strong
as not to be drowned, when the wind blows, by a
thousand lesser scents from field and wood and farmyard.</p>

<p>Wood pigeons coo in the high-shaded storeys of the
beeches and in the wet willow copses where bushes and
herbage have grown so dense that hardly a bird’s-nester
or a lover would care to penetrate them. In the dark
wood alleys, all day long, hang insects whose wings
seem to be still in their swiftness, like golden lamps.</p>

<p>The gardens have amber lilies, fuchsia trees, phloxes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
poppies, hollyhocks, carnations, snap-dragons, rockets
and red flax rising above rose of Sharon and lemon-scented
balm and yellow stone-crop, where the tortoise-shell
butterflies worship with opening wings.</p>

<p>And on the garden walls the purple plums ooze and
heave in the sun with yellow wasps that give a touch of
horror to the excellent and abounding life of perfect
summer.</p>

<p>These things and many more the eye notes carelessly.
We are so rich that we do not count our treasure. We
record them as contented worshippers their beads. They
are but as dust above the corn when the thresher twists
his oaken flail. The mother or master of them all seems
to be the line of the chalk hills.</p>

<p>The corn sweeps to these hills, and on the strand which
divides them is a hamlet of six thatched cottages and a
farmhouse, and new haystacks round these, fine and
sharp-angled, and old ones carved in steps and supported
by props of ash. The cream pans and the churns glitter
outside the house. A girl kneels at the brook that flows
past and dips a jug among the cresses, trying to catch a
trout at the same time. The eye dwells on these for a
little while, saying that it could be content there never
to wander again, and then rises to the downs, and away
it goes, soaring as at the sound of organ or harp. For
how proud-thoughted are these long, curving downs,
whether they make a highway at noon for round white
clouds or at night for the large moon. They uplift and
allure and lead far away the eye. The mind follows the
eye as the streaming wake follows the ship and is naught
without it. Those curves suggest to the mind, confused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and languid after long summer days in the lowland, that
it also might follow such curves that lead on&mdash;surely&mdash;to
noble thoughts and high discoveries, though without
them it will be happy merely in following with joyous
undulations to the windy beeches on the furthest height.
To see them close by with our last glance before entering
an inn is good, or, far off, on a midsummer night
when we are to watch the sun rise from the encampment
which makes one of them, or to fancy them by
the winter fire; but to see them thus, in full summer,
when day is separate from day only by brief, perfumed
nights of stars, stimulates like a page of saga or history
or a perfect rhyme, setting the heart free. “Let us be
brave,” says a shepherd of these hills.</p>

<span class="smaller">AUTUMN BELLS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>From this beechen hill I can see into and across
a long pastoral valley at my feet; its gentle sides running
east and west are clothed in wood, and at the western
end, where the valley leads straight out into the western
sky, a stone city lies. Beyond this valley to the south
are the misty, wooded ridges that hint at other valleys.
The sunset light has made the landscape immense, but
with the help of autumn it has made it simple too; and
the sound of bells in the city seems to have created it,
rounded and mellow in outline and hue. The little
rounds of hedge-tops and knolls in the meadows and
gorse in the higher slopes harmonise and run into the
larger rounds of the single oaks in the middle distance,
and the still larger rounds of the hills and their cloudy
woods, and the clouds above them. A hawk in the air
might seem to be carving the outlines of some perfect
palm tree as he flies. The white steam also of a slow
train far away bubbles up in the moist and gentle air and
hangs there long in delicately changing and merging
mounds that mock the clouds and woods. The amber
wheat stacks are of the same family of form, lying in
a half circle at one side of a hunched farmhouse that
lifts up a dome of mossy thatch,&mdash;near it a garden of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
shadowed wallflower, snapdragon, roses, in clouds beyond
clouds, with a burning edge of hollyhock, sunflower, red-hot
poker and chrysanthemum.</p>

<p>The sound of the city bells continues to overflow in
bubbles from the valley, up and up, to the round, golden
clouds. As if filled with the sound, the city smoke
ascends and takes on the colours of the sunset.</p>

<p>The sun is now low between the final walls of hill,
where the valley ends, and it seems to belong to the city
below, as if it were the city’s god descending there for
once in answer to some especially rich altar or noble
deed. The towers and their bells are as maidens
pensively embroidering, and now and then dropping their
embroidery to sing a melody of something far away; and
long after the sun has gone and the city has disappeared
their song is repeated in the fragrant and noiseless
abysses of the far-stretched night.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV<br />

<span class="smaller">SUNDAY</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The morning air of autumn smelt like the musky,
wild white rose. The south wind had carried hither
all the golden and brown savours from Devon and
Wiltshire and Surrey; and the strong sweetness made
the walker snuff deeply at it, with uplifted upper lip.
Church bells two miles away, deep among the woods
that lay around narrow gulfs of meadow on every side,
called and called, as if they had wedded this perfume
and all the gold and brown of the wide land. Not the
last willow wren in the oak, nor the cooing dove, spoke
more melodiously of autumn and repose than the bells.
So when I came to the church, under a cavernous beech
wood, I paused beneath the low tower and sate in the
cool nave.</p>

<p>Parts of the windows were still rich with old colour,
the rest might seem to have flown into the woods as
the sounds from the genial bells were still flying thither
and through the autumn land. The church was the
lovely home of the dead of several fair families still
living near. A helmet with motionless crest jutted
over the nave. Several bright, crude effigies flaunted
their crimson and blue in one aisle. The walls were
still half covered by paintings of varying clearness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Here and there a sword stood out quite clear, or the
head of a woman or a youth, a coat of armour, an
aureole that some head had lost, a curve of vesture, or
a mere whisper of colour, red like old blood, or a few
words, such as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">olim magnificus pulcherrimus</span>”&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">periit</span>”&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">resurget</span>”;
things that survived there much
as events in human memories, and as incidents and expressions
may actually survive our death, and painfully
strive for integration in a dim world of fragments that
shall be strangely arrayed again.</p>

<p>The clerk stood looking out of a little open window
that revealed a piece of green meadow and yellow maple
that might have belonged to the ancient glass.</p>

<p>One by one the men came in, two old labourers past
work, a neighbouring farmer, his cowman and carter, a
gamekeeper, and the women and children in twos and
threes, and lastly the squire&mdash;perhaps twenty-five altogether.
In hymn and psalm and prayer all voices save
those of the rector and one sweet-voiced child were so
faint that the church was undisturbed. The old men
were still, the young restless, the women and children
interested in one another; but they were fainter than
the figures on the wall, being so like thousands of others,
all but a red and fair-haired man of fifty who might
have been a Bacchus hastily metamorphosed for some
jolly purpose.</p>

<p>With the sermon the silence became immense, as if
it must flower suddenly or crumble away in a roar.
The preacher spoke slowly as one who scorned time,
and in the intervals could be heard the masticating of
horses in the meadow outside. He spoke of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
necessity of “drawing near to God”&mdash;by a life of
piety, by private prayer, by communion, by worshipping
in this house. His rich, gentle voice saying murmurous
things fell upon me as one of sleep’s forerunners,
and I had just heard him asking the squire and the
Bacchus and the rest whether they had not, at the
Communion, had visions of “those tabernacles above,”
when I began to dream a dream which the parson
could not have inspired without the help of some very
different elf who now lay under the pavement of the
nave, or was painted on the wall, or had sat among the
rushes when the church was beautiful and young as a
country bride. For it seemed that I saw these men
and women in a kind of heaven where all day long for
ever they did those things which had pleased or most
taken hold of them in life. I saw them like the
figures painted on the wall, some bright and clear, some
dim or broken, some known by hardly more than a
defacement of the large light that dwelt there.</p>

<p>There the grave and cheerful carter went home at
evening, looking ahead steadily, without sorrow, or alarm,
or lassitude, and sometimes turning to his undulating
team, noting their still bright harness and speaking to
them by name: “Ho! Violet”&mdash;“Smiler”&mdash;“Darling”&mdash;“Swallow.”
He was even now hungry, a little tired,
thinking of his inn at nightfall. Heaven had caught him
and made of him a picture of strength, contentment and
evening which, in that luminous land, was pleasing yet to
mortal men.</p>

<p>There the cowman was leading out the bull, and
making the ring jar in its nostrils. Still his back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
knees were bent as he cursed out “Jimmy,” his face
still moulded and unmoulded by faint-hearted lust, vexation,
fear, perplexed by the home where his eleven children
were, with his pigs and his fledgling magpies.</p>

<p>His wife was near, but almost invisible, and as it were
a wraith of pitiful maternity, neither bitter nor glad,
but bearing her burdens, one still beneath her girdle,
one in her arms, and others demanding her anxiety,
winning her tenderness, on this side and on that.</p>

<p>The gamekeeper stood, with smoking gun barrels,
and a cloud of jay’s feathers still in the air and among
the May foliage about him. Pride, stupidity, servility
clouded his face as in his days of nature, and above him
in the oaks innumerable jays laughed because beauty,
like folly, was immortal there.</p>

<p>The squire, more faint, and whether to his joy or
not I could not discern, was standing under a bough
on which hung white owls, wood owls, falcons, crows,
magpies, cats, hedgehogs, stoats, weasels, some bloody,
some with gaping stomachs, some dismembered or crushed,
some fleshless, some heaving like boiling fat, and on them
and him the sun shone hot.</p>

<p>The red-faced man sat drinking ale, and with him
it seemed always evening, and his stomach fathomless.</p>

<p>Five boys&mdash;four of them with blackened faces and
sticks or swords, and one of them dressed as a woman
and carrying a bag&mdash;played the Pace-Egging Play in
blue Easter weather in a daffodil lane before a ripe grey
farmhouse.</p>

<p>A little girl nursed something musingly, whether a
mole or a cluster of rags I could not tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The farmer sat on his cream pony, brow-beating a
birdnesting boy by a gate.</p>

<p>A young woman waited by a stile and did up her
hair.</p>

<p>And still the parson threw back his head and closed
his eyes, and with an action as of washing his hands,
talked melodiously and with satisfaction, saying, at last,
“It is well for us to draw near unto the Lord.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FIRST DAFFODILS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>It was one of those early March days in a mountainous
country when a warmly clothed man, in good health and
walking rapidly, can just foretaste the spring. The icy
dark water in stony brooklets shone golden whenever it
could find the sun. This gold seemed a brand upon the
winter that marked it for death. There was gold also on
the turf between the walls and the roadways, for there
were hundreds of celandine flowers: it was to be found
also in the miniature forests of the moss that made
detached and placid worlds upon every stone of the walls;
in the little hollow woods, or steep and craggy orchard
plots, where the first daffodils were unveiled; in the
rickyards where fowls scattered the gleaming straw; in
the fur of the squirrel that moved as if the swirling wind
dissolved and shaped it again continually; in the warm
ale at “The White Hart.”</p>

<p>But when the eye grew proud and the wind rose and
every half hour the horizontal snow put out everything of
the world except its noises&mdash;the cry of the curlew, the
buzz of pewits’ wings, the song of the missel thrush that
came through the storm like a mere ode to liberty in the
midst of revolution&mdash;then it was winter still, and the
rustling oak leaves talked of December. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the snowfall ceased with a rush as if upon the wings of a
peregrine, those small signs of spring were no more than
a child’s sand castles on a vast sea shore, and not so noticeable
as the thick suds and flakes of snow hanging from the
hedges on the walls and turned to mists by the restless
robins.</p>

<p>On one side, for some miles, ran a large fell that was
a home and playground of winds, steep and long to be
crossed, and all white and grim, shutting out home and
the pleasures that are found among men. On the other
side, steep also and widely shaped with small, precipitous
crags and angry surf of heather and here and there
haggish thorns, lay a moor. Between these two the road
rose and fell over lesser but steep hills, and from one hilltop
I could see the sea beyond the moor. It was grey,
without light, with long quivering lines that never ended,
but insubstantial; it seemed rather the grisly offspring of
a mind made pregnant by the wintry melancholy. The
mountains came down to the edge of it, like lions to
drink, ten miles away. Not a house was visible, and on
the sea the few ships were like the water itself, inventions
of my own, as it were, which I had launched upon
that infinite desolation for sport.</p>

<p>All day, ahead and always at the same distance, rose
high mountains, with crude outlines as of heavy and
frosty land fresh turned by the plough; the long ravines
of snow upon their sides made their peaks more sharp and
their heights more sudden. They haunted the day.</p>

<p>Now and then the snow fell, and in the weak sunshine
that followed, the light struck up from the snow and
made the white breasts of the gulls seem opal lanterns full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of flame, and the hazel thickets were nets of silver and
crystal branches, invisible in their own splendour.</p>

<p>I descended to a small deep river that ran, with noble
curves of power, solemn and full of some inhuman simple
purpose. For a moment the sunlight fell on one curve of
it and the windy waves were now a stately glittering
cavalcade, and now a dance of fairies into which some ass-headed
Bottom suddenly intruded with a gust from a
cloud, making them whirl faster and then disappear.
But the river was careless of the light; it went on as
before, unchanged even when for another moment all that
grim, serious water was changed into white spray and
light by a fall.</p>

<p>And there still were the mountains ahead. Their
painful distances of long, white, houseless steeps made the
mind suffer the body’s agony of toiling there, of being lost
there in storm, of being there on a still, dark night.
They bred&mdash;by means of natural, human sympathy with
the difficulty of life among such heights, by the horror of
the distance, the coldness, the whiteness&mdash;a languor out
of which emerged infinite admiration and awe, a sense of
beauty even, and unquestionably a kind of pride in the
powers of the human spirit that can dwell upon the earth
and be the equal of these things, sharing with them the
sunlight and the darkness, enduring like them vicissitudes,
decay, violent disaster, and like them disbelieving in the
future and in death, except for others. So when at
nightfall the snowy hills made a semicircle round the head
of an enormous grey estuary, and couched there ten and
fifteen and twenty miles away as if the sweep of a puissant
arm had made them in clearing a space for the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
they were purely beautiful, while over them a large,
simple sunset threw a golden bridge between towering,
white, still clouds.</p>

<p>Then, at length, a hamlet on a hill; first, a farmyard
on one side of the road and a farmhouse on the other;
then four or five stone cottages; lastly an inn where I
thought to sleep. Hardly had I sat down than a pedlar
came in and sat beside me. He was a tall, grave man of
a gritty, brown complexion and big, straight features;
from his simple, heroic face, that seemed an animated
piece of crag from his native hills, his blue eyes looked at
me with that glance, fearless of any return, which the
ordinary man gives to a dog or a labourer, but presently
became more modest as I looked up and down the blue
gaberdine which he wore down to his knees.</p>

<p>The gaberdine was of the stoutest linen, heavy and
warm. It opened for about six inches down from the
neck, back and front, and was fastened with small bone
buttons. On each side of these openings it was smocked
in an elaborate pattern nine inches deep; the wide, turn-down
collar almost covered the embroidered shoulder
straps and was itself adorned with seven rows of feather
stitching. The sleeves were smocked both at the
shoulders and the wrists, and were finished with broad,
feather-stitched cuffs. He wore it because it was decent,
and he would always wear one so long as the woman
lived who could make it.</p>

<p>I asked him about his trade, and he said that he pursued
it among these hills and valleys all the winter, setting it
aside for work in the fields during the summer months.
He was born in one of the cottages close by; so was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
father before him and so were his children after him.
They were happy there. Death alone disturbed them
now and then; and death, he said, was incurable and to
be expected. In the spring he spent less on candles and
his orchard bloomed, and there was a marriage or two in
the church and the ewes dropped their lambs. In the
summer it was warm without fires, and they needed no
candles, and he had what he desired&mdash;what that was he
did not say. In the autumn he remembered that things
were coming round again, winter soon and then spring
again. In the winter his cottage walls were thick, and if
the days were short he had always had a fire and some
food, and had never yet refused a beggar something;
there were songs also: and as to his trade, of course he
liked it, and he did not think people could do without
him.</p>

<p>“And now, young man,” he said, “who are you, what
have you seen, and what is your country?”</p>

<p>He looked at me with something like the benignity
of a child accepting a spoonful of honey; but for that
joy and expectancy I might have spoken easily. I
hesitated between the truth, which was difficult and
perhaps to him unintelligible, my own view of the truth,
which would be so confused by reservations and after-thoughts
that it could not please, and the picturesque.
So I <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am a poor, modern man”&mdash;which was true&mdash;“I
have seen nothing”&mdash;which was my view of the truth&mdash;and
finally, “the great city of London is my country”&mdash;which
was picturesque.</p>

<p>“What?” said he, not angrily, not pityingly, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
inquiringly, “what do you mean by a ‘poor, modern man,’
and how is it that you have seen nothing?”</p>

<p>A thousand things crowded to my brain and contended
on my lips. This was an opportunity, but too great a
one, too sudden. I stifled my designs and decided to say
nothing. He was kind; he nodded gracefully and continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tell me about London.”</p>

<p>He did not say, “Do me an essay of fifteen hundred
words by next week.” That might have been easy;
writing&mdash;possibly even good writing&mdash;is comparatively
easy; because the writer is alone while he writes and is
not present while his work is read, and he can therefore
withhold what seems difficult to express and he deceives
without appearing deceitful; moreover, he writes at his
ease, or should do, what is probably read in haste. But
in conversation with an aged blue-eyed man, in a majestic
blue gaberdine, who has an evening’s leisure and desires
the truth, asking simply: “Tell me about London,” the
difficulties in the way of a simple man are enormous. I
said something about a book called <cite>The Soul of London</cite>;
but he could not read. He wished again to be informed
what the soul of a city was. Again I failed him.</p>

<p>“But you have actually lived in London,” he repeated,
encouraging me.</p>

<p>“Yes.” He seemed to be proud, as who should say,
“I sit with one who has lived in the most famous city in
the world.”</p>

<p>I remembered that there are said to be five millions of
human beings in London, and that its streets on end
would reach to the moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Also I thought of the old song and the <span class="lock">verse:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“There be kings and queens in London town</div>
       <div class="verse">A-sitting all of a row.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In despair I actually ventured to tell him that there
were five million people there. But he seemed to be poor

<p>“There is.”</p>

<p>But still his questions came. How did the ships come
up and unlade again? What were the army and the
navy like? Had I seen the famous men? Were the
people noble as became a metropolitan race? Achilles
questioning Ulysses in Hades could not have spoken
more magnificently than this old man questioning me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
though I seemed the ghost and he the visitor to the
underworld. Yet in some sort his great questions,
elevating his soul, seemed to supply him, if not with an
answer, at least with some satisfaction. I would have
spoken, if I could. But how short the evening! myself
how unprepared and inadequate! I would have told him
of Pimlico and Battersea which were not entirely unknown
to me. I would have said that there were sorrowful and
happy men there&mdash;thousands of both, unknown to me
and unknown to one another; thousands of houses,
beautiful, stately, pompous, indifferent, ugly, sublimely
squalid; that upon them as upon him and his neighbours
fell rain and sun and snow and the wind beat and death
came suddenly, desired or undesired; that the city was as
vast as Time, which had made it, and that to know it a
man must live and die the lives and deaths of all that had
ever lived and died there. But he ceased to regard me.

<p>Terrible, noble old man! No doubt he expected me
to speak as simply as that, so I slipped away from him and

flowers. With those reticent, dark silences and spaces I
tried to console myself.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MIRROR</span></h3>
</div>


<p>There are a hundred little landscapes on the walls by
the roadside&mdash;of grey or silver or golden stone, embossed
and fretted and chequered by green and gold-pointed
mosses, frosty lichens, pale round penny-wort leaves and the
orange foliage of cranesbill. At their feet are the young
leaves of the larger celandine and the lustrous blossoms of
the lesser, still swaddled in dead leaves where mice and
squirrels are questing. On top, thorns and ash trees trail
horizontally in many dragon shapes, and purple brambles
overhang. Or there are low thorns which make way at
intervals for straight hollies, spared by the billhook, or even
carved by it into pagoda-like shapes. Sometimes even a
thorn has been thus spared and honoured, but here they
are not each knotted into impenetrable globes of twigs or
interlaced in pairs as elsewhere. What fantasy persuades
men to make those little wayside and even railwayside
suggestions of a mild tree worship surviving yet? In
places the walls are interrupted and replaced by a smooth,
blue sheet of natural rock based in grass and making a
home for vertebrate ferns, and stamped by white and
yellow and green algæ which look as if they were the
stains of a sunshine too strong to be wiped out. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the ash tree boles are heavily draped in a fur woven
inextricably of dark green and fine-leaved ivy, pale green
moss over which hover pendulous drops of gold, silver
lichen, and ferns green and amber. Out of rock or wall
gushes bright, crystal water, losing itself in moss and
herbage below, or received into small stone tanks, and
turned into a darkly gleaming, golden creature that throbs
under the rain.</p>

<p>Between such walls the road winds into many valleys
and over many fells towards the mountains. On either
hand rise and fall many hollowed tawny meadows, with
boulders embedded in heather and flowering gorse, and
over them the pewits plunge and soar and modulate their
crying by their speed. Here and there a family of oak or
beech stands up in the midst of the fields. Between the
meadows there are copses of hazel and oak, and snowdrops
underneath, or a crisp, untrodden carpet of old leaves of
many dying golds and browns and reds; or an arable field
intervenes. The plough climbs the hill, turning the dry,
grey soil to purple and brown that is dappled by rooks
and gulls. Some of the gulls slide overhead against the
wind, inclining their wings this way and that, rising and
descending slightly, as if they could by tacking and
delaying avoid the streamy wind.</p>

<p>The steeper hills are the home of oak and ash and
birch and larch. The grey larch woods waver in colour
like a dying trout, as the wind and the sunshine pass over
them. In a five-minute shower the rainbow sets her foot
among the trees before she leaps across the sky, and while
yet her colours are uncertain among the luminous branches
makes a small, fairy, remote world that speaks to the eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
like the young moon on a fair evening or Cassiopeia when
it crowns a sapphire night.</p>

<p>In ten miles there is an inn. “Pretty Polly” and
“Sceptre” are on the walls, with notices of sales and
advertisements of spirits. The hostess sings the cosmic
melody of “Blue Bell” as she goes about her work&mdash;that
marvellous melody over which farmboys become romantic
and even cheerful at four o’clock on wild and sleety
mornings in January as they go about their work. But the
host has good ale, and he can sing the Holm-bank
Hunting <span class="lock">Song:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The road has turned away into a valley. The
mountains are close ahead, and the billowy moorland
prepares me for them, with hawks in all its hollows, and
small ponds, the silent sport of winds that roar in crags
and hiss in grasses, and then at length a long, blue pool,
edged by yellow reeds and receiving the shadow of a steep
oak wood. There the wind is lured into many metamorphoses
among the ripples&mdash;at one moment a writhing,
hundred-headed snake, at another the wraith perhaps of a
swift skater who was once drowned in the water, and
again a swarm of dark bees. At first sight this blue
expanse, with narrow ends running into the moorland,
and its edge of shivering reed, lays hold upon the mind.
All day, unseen of any but the shepherd, the water reflects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the birds and the clouds, and all night the stars, until it
might be supposed to have acquired a symbolic sadness
and tranquillity by thus keeping watch on all the nights
and days since it began. There, in its depths, hang the
mountain clouds and the immense spaces of sky, with
something added by the reflecting water, as if it were some
gloomy opiate personality that turned all things to its own
tune. Even the joyous, golden fleece of the perfect
summer morning are rendered by the pool with touches
of wizardry and night, and when a little breeze erases
them for a moment it is like a breath of delight sweeping
over an immortal pain. The nearest mountain, too, is
there. The highest summit, engraved with snow, shows
in the depths like a bleached skull emerging from ridgy
tracts of dark sand. There, also, are the long, tawny
and olive flanks of the ascent, inlaid with purple and blue
by precipices and cloud-shadows, with grey and ruddy
woods below, and the silver wounds of birches. Now and
then my own shadow flits among them, as if a magician
had compelled me to wander in that giddy profound of
water and sky. As I look down I seem to see what men
have made of the universe in the past, with the help of
poet and priest, by plunging it in the sorrows and uncertainties
of their own heart and brain. There is superstition,
there religion and poetry, confining the great heavens
and the hills with sun and moon and stars, within these
few acres of desolate mountain water. There are the
stories of the gods and of a heaven that overhung mortals
with hideous aspect. There, also, the eager courage of
man’s soul when first he tried to burst “the strong bars of
Nature’s gateways”&mdash;while the sun and wind contend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
upon the water&mdash;and set out upon the adventure which
has made us “equal with heaven.” Looking up, away
from the pool, there still are the mountains and the sky,
just as they were, still inscrutably holding out in one hand
laughter and in one hand tears for us to choose from. I
look down and the singing lark, against a white cloud, is
singing high and wise things in some contemplative poet’s
verse. I look up and, behold! the new joy of the spring,
unintelligible, and for the moment not asking to be understood,
but to be shared; and as we climb happily the pool
no longer imposes its version of life, for yonder is the
True upon the hills, and the eyes dilate and the nostrils
and the lungs accept the air and the “darling of men
and gods ... mistress of the nature of things” takes her
place with us.</p>

<span class="smaller">UNDER THE MOOR</span></h3>
</div>


<p>It was June, but it had been like March for many
miles upon the rough moor until, with the dawn, I came
to a lowland where there were mossy fields with clear
rain pools among the flowering gorse; and meadows cut
into two planes by small, perpendicular cliffs of stone, so
that on one the cattle were already feeding in the early
light and on the other still lying down; and wheat fields
that had islands of stone in their midst; and then at last
an immense meadow sloping down towards fresh oak
woods and the sea, and rising out of it rounded beechen
knolls which, Druid-like, preserved the night under their
domes of foliage, though all the grass was flooded by the
slow tides of dawn. The white cow-parsley flowers
hovered around me on invisible stems and gave out the
thick summer flavours of nettles and myriad grasses.
And lying down and sleeping in the sun until morning
was hot, I awoke and seemed to hear a tale of the south
as the air grew mazy with the scent of elder and thyme
and the colour of bird’s-foot lotus and all the grass, and
the sky leaned down upon the earth in milky purples. It
was just such a change from the poor land to the rich as
is expressed in the ancient tale of Cherry of Zennor told
by Hunt in his <cite>Popular Romances of the West of England</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl, Cherry of Zennor, could not contentedly put
up with her life at home, because her parents were poor,
living on potatoes and fish, and she, though she was
pretty and could run like a hare, had never a ribbon for
her curls nor a new frock to go to church or to fair in.
So she set out to get a servant’s place somewhere in the
“low countries.”</p>

<p>The road was long and she was homesick by the time
she had reached a four-went way. There she sat down
and cried, but had scarcely recovered when she saw a
gentleman coming up to her. He bade her “good-morning”
and asked her whither she went; and when
she said that she was off to look for a servant’s place, he
told her that he was in search of just such a clean and
handsome girl for his own house. So Cherry went off
with him, to milk his cow and look after his child; and
she was to have good clothes when she got there.</p>

<p>They went down and down for a long way; the road
was clouded over by trees and was growing darker and
darker, when suddenly the man opened a gate in a wall
and told her that there it was that he lived. She had
never seen a garden so rich in fruit and flowers and
singing birds. Was it enchanted? But no, the man
was no fairy; he was too big. Presently his child
appeared, a boy with piercing and crafty eyes, and an old
hag, called “Aunt Prudence,” who prepared a choice
supper for the girl; and she ate of it heartily. Cherry
slept with the child at the top of the house and was told
that, even if she could not sleep, she was to keep her eyes
shut up there and not to speak to the boy; at dawn she
was to wash him at a spring in the garden and rub his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
eyes&mdash;never her own&mdash;with an ointment; then she was
to milk the cow and give the boy a bowl of the last milk;
she was at all times to avoid curiosity.</p>

<p>All this she did until it came to milking the cow. But
Cherry saw no cow and was calling “Pruit! Pruit!
Pruit!” when out she came from among the trees as if
from nowhere. All day, but it was easy work, she
scalded milk, made butter, cleaned platters and bowls
with water and sand, picked the fruit, weeded the garden.
Sometimes the man kissed her for her pains.</p>

<p>A year passed. Aunt Prudence was sent away because
she took Cherry into one of the forbidden rooms, where
the floor was like glass and it was full of people turned to
stone. Sometimes the master went away and left Cherry
alone with the child.</p>

<p>The ointment was still a puzzle&mdash;but surely it made
the child’s eyes see many things! So one day she
anointed her own eyes with it. It burned her painfully,
and running to the spring to wash it away she learned its
power. For there, at the bottom of the water, was a
world of little people at play and among them her master;
and looking up she saw that the branches of the trees and
the flowers and the grass were crowded with the same
joyous people. Another day she looked through the keyhole
of one of the forbidden rooms and saw her master
there, and many ladies too, all singing, and one of these
who looked like a queen he kissed. So when, as they
were fruit gathering some time afterwards, the master
leaned forward to kiss her, she struck him on the face,
saying, that he might kiss the small people under the
water. Next morning very early he called her from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
bed, led her by the light of a lantern up the dark lane for
a long way, and then disappeared, after telling her that
at times she would still be able to see him on the hills;
and when she had recovered from her sorrow she went
home.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIX<br />

<span class="smaller">A HARVEST MOON</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The first steep cornfield under the edge of the red
moor lay all rough and warm with stubble in the evening
light. The corn sheaves themselves were of a shining
gold and leaned together in shocks that made long, low
tents and invited the wayfarer to shelter and sleep. We
had come over the moor for hours and this field was the
beginning of a deep valley that stretched to the sea.
Yonder was the sea, ten miles away, with a row of lights
running out upon a nose of land far into it. The valley
held one village half way towards the sea and several
white farmhouses which sent the smoke of supper to
explore the neighbouring ash trees.</p>

<p>A stream running straight from the moor gave us water
and we ate our supper leaning against a corn shock. Our
pipes soon went out, what with fatigue and indulgence in
the warmth and the pleasant valley, brimming with
summer haze and golden still.</p>

<p>We had been alone when, just as the light was going,
two farm boys and a girl came into the field without
noticing us. The girl sat at the top of the field and the
boys took off their coats and laid them beside her. She
arranged their folds and then sat straight up to watch.
For down the field ran the boys, striding heavily side by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
side, each leaping the same shock until they had reached
the bottom wall almost at the same time, where they
argued and made claims to victory in broken voices.
They walked quickly up again to the girl and threw
themselves down panting, close to her, arguing together
as much as they could without breath.</p>

<p>The girl laughed and said something; then they rose
up and raced again, the heavier one this time encouraging
himself with groans at each leap over the sheaves, flinging
himself over with so much ferocity that he tumbled at
the end well in front.</p>

<p>“You can jump, no mistake,” said the girl to the
winner. “But what’s the matter with you?” she asked
the other, putting a foxglove between her lips. Both
were too much out of breath to speak, but in a few
minutes started again. They ran faster than ever; they
leapt well over the tops of the shocks, so high as to
stumble at each descent. The winner of the last race
could only just keep level with the other, and seemed
about to collapse at each thundering jump, when his rival,
beginning a great leap too early, fell in the middle of the
shock and lost the race. They returned, the winner
first, and lay sprawling, panting full in the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“Well, Luke, you have won, and there’s your kiss,”
she said to the heavier lad.</p>

<p>“And, John, you have been beaten; we did not say
what the loser should have, so here’s two for you,” she
went on, this time taking the flower out of her mouth.
“And now, lads, race again!”</p>

<p>This time the race was never in doubt. John took
each leap as if he aimed at the harvest moon that rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
before him. Luke tripped at several sheaves, and, at the
bottom, climbed over the stone wall and disappeared. As
to John, he came back and began racing and leaping
alone, until the girl, feeling cold or in need of some
company, went off and left the proud fellow to the moon
and the line of shocks.</p>

<p>The night was dark and solid rain tumultuously invested
the inn. As I stood in a dim passage I could see
through the bar into the cloudy parlour, square and white,
surrounded by settles, each curving about a round table
made of one piece of elm on three legs. A reproduction
of “Rent Day” and a coloured picture of a bold Spanish
beauty hung on the wall, which, for the rest, was sufficiently
adorned by the sharp shadows of men’s figures
and furniture that mingled grotesquely. All the men but
one leaned back upon the settles or forward upon the
tables, their hands on their tankards, watching the one
who sang a ballad&mdash;a ballad known to them so well that
they seemed not to listen, but simply to let the melody
surge about them and provoke what thoughts it would.</p>

<p>At some time, perhaps many times in his life, every
man is likely to meet with a thing in art or nature or
human life or books which astonishes and gives him a
profound satisfaction, not so much because it is rich or
beautiful or strange, as because it is a symbol of a thing
which, without the symbol, he could never grasp and
enjoy. The German archers making a target of
Leonardo’s sculptured horse and horsemen at Milan;
the glory of purple that has flown from a painted church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
window and settled upon a peasant’s shoulders for an
hour; the eloquence, as of an epigram rich in anger and
woe, of one bare branch that juts out from a proud green
wood into the little midnight stars and makes them smaller
with its splendid pang; a woodman felling one by one the
black and golden oak trees in the spring and slaying their
ancient shadows; or, in a discreet and massive crowd, one
jet of laughter, so full of joy or defiance or carelessness
that it seems to cut through the heavy air like the whistle
of a bullet&mdash;the world is one flame of these blossoms,
could we but see. Music has many of them in her gift.
Music, the rebel, the martyr, the victor&mdash;music, the
romantic cry of matter striving to become spirit&mdash;is itself
such a symbol, and there is no melody so poor that it will
not at some time or another, to our watchful or receptive
minds, have its festal hour in which it is crowned or at
least crucified, for our solemn delight. “Dolly Gray” I
have heard sung all day by poor sluttish women as they
gathered peas in the broad, burning fields of July, until it
seemed that its terrible, acquiescent melancholy must
have found a way to the stars and troubled them.</p>

<p>And of all music, the old ballads and folk songs and
their airs are richest in the plain, immortal symbols. The
best of them seem to be written in a language that should
be universal, if only simplicity were truly simple to mankind.
Their alphabet is small; their combinations are
as the sunlight or the storm, and their words also are
symbols. Seldom have they any direct relation to life as
the realist believes it to be. They are poor in such detail
as reveals a past age or a country not our own. They
are in themselves epitomes of whole generations, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
whole countryside. They are the quintessence of many
lives and passions made into a sweet cup for posterity. A
myriad hearts and voices have in age after age poured
themselves into the few notes and words. Doubtless, the
old singers were not content, but we, who know them
not, can well see in their old songs a kind of immortality
for them in wanderings on the viewless air. The men
and women&mdash;who hundreds of years ago were eating and
drinking and setting their hearts on things&mdash;still retain a
thin hold on life through the joy of us who hear and sing
their songs, or tread their curving footpaths, or note their
chisel marks on cathedral stones, or rest upon the undulating
churchyard grass. The words, in league with a
fair melody, lend themselves to infinite interpretations,
according to the listener’s heart. What great literature
by known authors enables us to interpret thus by virtue
of its subtlety, ballads and their music force us to do by
their simplicity. The melody and the story or the song
move us suddenly and launch us into an unknown. They
are not art, they come to us imploring a new lease of life
on the sweet earth, and so we come to give them something
which the dull eye sees not in the words and notes
themselves, out of our own hearts, as we do when we
find a black hearthstone among the nettles, or hear the
clangour of the joyous wild swan, invisible overhead, in
the winter dawn.</p>

<p>In the parlour of the inn the singer stood up and sang
of how a girl was walking alone in the meadows of spring
when she saw a ship going out to sea and heard her true
love crying on board; and he sailed to the wars and
much he saw in strange countries, but never came back;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and still she walks in the meadows and looks out to sea,
though she is old, in the spring. He sang without stirring,
without expression, except in so far as light and darkness
from his own life emerged enmeshed among the deep
notes. He might have been delivering an oracle of
solemn but ambiguous things. And so in fact he was.
By its simplicity and remoteness from life the song set
going the potent logic of fancy which would lead many
men to diverse conclusions. It excluded nothing of
humanity except what baseness its melody might make
impossible. The strangeness and looseness of its framework
allowed each man to see himself therein, or some
incident or dream in his life, or something possible to a
self which he desired to be or imagined himself to be, or
perhaps believed himself once to have been. There were
no bounds of time or place. It included the love of Ruy
Blas, of Marlowe, of Dante, of Catullus, of Kilhwch, of
Swift, of Palomides, of Hazlitt, of Villon.... And that
little inn, in the midst of mountains and immense night,
seemed a temple of all souls, where a few faithful ones
still burnt candles and remembered the dead.</p>

<span class="smaller">A MARCH HAUL</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The white houses on the hill are whiter than ever
before in the early light and the south wind from over
the sea. The soft, wheat-coloured sand is inscribed far
from the water by the black scrawl of the overpast storm.
But now the sea is broken by sliding ripples so small that
they seem only the last, discontented efforts of the wind
to make the surface one perfect floor of glass. The
curving, foamy lines waver and swirl and are about to
disappear and leave the desired level when others are born
unnoticeably. The black hulls of the leaning ships gleam
and darken the water, and by their reflections give it an
immeasurable depth which contrasts strangely with its
lucid tranquillity and the drowned roses of the departing
dawn, for in the high blue sky some of the sunrise clouds
have lost their way and hang, still rosy, near the zenith,
round the transparent moon. The mist over the sea at
the horizon is golden.</p>

<p>Sea and shore are at rest, all but one group of men who
are welcoming a little ship that comes in upon the tide,
fragrant and stately and a little weary, as with folded
arms, solemn also as if she were invading, or perhaps
bringing mysterious gifts for the ancient, wintry land.</p>

<p>And now they are hauling in the deeply-laden boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
that seems on this fair morning to have brought the
spring out of the sea; and that is why they strain grimly
to have her safe on the storm-strewn shore. She is laden
with flowers, with anemones and primroses for the woods,
violets for the banks, marigolds for the brooks and the
ungrazed, rushy corners of long fields, daffodils for the
stone walls and the short turf at the edges of copses,
stitchwort for the hedgerows, bittersweet may for the
hawthorns, gold for the willows, white and rosy blossom
for the old orchards among the hills, mezereon, jonquils,
rockets, plume poppies and snapdragons and roses for the
gardens; and the men heave and groan as if they feared
lest the sea should still rob them of some.</p>

<p>All the leaves are there&mdash;the sweet hawthorn green
which the children chew, the dewy, pensile leaves of
hazel and beech and lime, the palmy ash leaves still
misty with purple flower, the oak leaves bronzed or gilded
among their rosy galls, and the streamers of the willow,
and all the grasses and reeds, and the tall young adder-headed
bracken for the moor, and ferns for the dripping
ledges of the waterfall; and the men heave without
resting, lest any should escape and so cheat them of
shaded ways for rest and sport and love.</p>

<p>There also are the birds&mdash;the gentle martins, swallows
that will seem the perfect flower of the home sweetness
in stern cottages on the heights and warm farmhouses in
the valleys, the chiffchaffs that shall sing in the ash and
the larch, the delicate wrens of the woodland crests and
the tempestuous nightingales of the thick-budded copses,
silent fly-catchers for the plum trees on southern walls,
cuckoos to shout over the dim water-meadows and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
pearly lichened oak woods, ousels to flash on the moors,
skiey swifts, doves to fill the green caverns of the beeches,
and all the chatterers that hide in blackthorn and cornel
thickets when it is best to walk among them; and the
men heave, for they are coming to the land even now.</p>

<p>Very near now are the lizards of the drowsy nettle-beds,
snakes to curl and uncurl upon the sunlit moss, and
blue sylphs for the rivulets. All are coming in from this
placid sea; and so the men heave, and the white houses
begin to glitter, and the golden mist over the sea promises
that days shall again be long, and men shall sit carelessly
on gates and sleep under the hedge at noon and adventure
and make plans in the pure mornings that are at
hand.</p>

<span class="smaller">FISHING BOATS</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The tide moves the river northward, towards me, under
the bridge on which I stand. On both sides it is lined for
a little way by houses: on the east in a flat, straight front,
on the west in irregular rocky masses. Those on the
east are coldly stained with light from the western sky;
those opposite are vaguely shadowed and have an airiness
and gloom&mdash;not a light yet appearing&mdash;as of the other
side of Lethe. The river is of noble breadth.</p>

<p>Against the eastern houses rise up the masses of seven
fishing boats in a row, with only such movement as makes
the shadow run into the brown and gold, or the gold and
brown into the shadow of the sails slowly, like the
unfolding of poppies: and under their sides the shadows
are profound as if they trailed black velvet mantles that
hid the water. For, away from the boats, the unrippled
surface of the motionlessly gliding river is of that lugubrious
silver that seems to be, not water, but some trick of
light upon mere air, such as is seen above summer meadows
in the heat.</p>

<p>And over all is bent a pale, soft, empurpled sky, and in
it a crescent moon.</p>

<p>Up the river came two fishing boats, sleeping, their
motion the only proof of the tide&mdash;no man visible on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
board&mdash;no voices&mdash;and their sails of a colour as if they
had been steeped in the early hues of the now vanished
sunset, and yet in their folds so dark that they seem to be
bringing with them the night as a cargo from those
cloudy black woods in the south. Beyond the large
curve of those woods the shining horn of the river
reaches the unseen sea. The spirit of the sea comes up
on the broad silent water.</p>

<p>The two small, solemn boats still glide in sleep; the
others dream at the quay.</p>

<p>Southward, the dark wood sends out the narcotic night
as a gift over the land, sowing the seeds of it from the
wings of the slow sea birds, from the two incoming boats,
silently; and now they have fallen upon good soil in the
seven boats on the quay, in the masses of houses, in the
arches of the bridge and in the hearts of men, and all
things drink oblivion. As I turn away there is a sound of
shrill, passionless voices that may be the souls of the
oblivious travelling to content somewhere in the rich
purple night.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLIII<br />

<span class="smaller">CLOUDS OVER THE SEA</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The high, partridge-coloured heathland rolls southward,
with small ridges as of a sea broken by cross winds, or as
if the heather and the hard gorse cushions had grown over
ruins which time had not yet smoothed into the right
curves of perfect death. A gentle wind changes the
grass from silver to green, from green to silver, by
depressing or lifting up the blades. In the dry heather
and pallid herbage the wind sounds all the stops of despair.
The note that each produces is faint, and the combination
hardly louder than the sound that fancy makes among the
tombs. Nevertheless, the enchantment of that little noise
pours into the air and heart a sympathy with the thousand
microscopic sorrows and uncertainties of the inanimate
world&mdash;a feeling that is part of the melancholy importunately
intruding on a day of early spring. The larks
rise, linking earth and sky with their songs, and the
stonechats are restless.</p>

<p>There are no trees. The only house is a little, white,
thatched cottage among some shining dark boats, on the
distant rosy shore.</p>

<p>The sea makes no sound. It changes with the sky so
often and so subtly that its variations are to be described,
if at all, in terms not of colour but of thought. All such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
moods as pass through the mind of a lonely man, during
long hours in a place where the outside world does not
disturb him and he lives on memory and pure reflection,
are symbolised by those changes on the surface of the sea.
Now it is one thing and now another; the growth is
imperceptible and those moods that have passed are as hard
to reconstruct as the links of a long, fluctuating reverie.
For the most part it is grey, a grey full of meditation and
discontent.</p>

<p>The heathland changes with the sea. Both take their
thoughts and fancies from the sky. For this is a world of
clouds; earth and sea are made by them what they
are. They make the sea, and they make the little pools,
blue, silver or grey, among the gorse. The clouds are
always there; inhabiting a dome that is about fifty miles
from the horizon up and down to the opposite horizon;
and yet they are never the same.</p>

<p>Where do the clouds go?</p>

<p>The large white clouds, mountainous and of alabaster
and with looks of everlastingness. I see them in the
north at midday, making the hills seem level with the
plain. I turn away my eyes and when next I look they
are gone. They vanish like childish things. One day I
made an appointment with another child to play marbles
on the next morning; I never went; I forgot; I never
saw the boy again, and I remember it now, for I never
played marbles after that.</p>

<p>The high white halcyons of summer skies.</p>

<p>The distant, icy ranges of rounded pearl down which, in
terrace after terrace, the sun walks like a king to the sea
in May. As I watch they grow big like roses in the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and they change and vanish and reappear beneath the
restless sculptor’s hand. If a man loves what is passing
away, he loves then.</p>

<p>Those little dove-like clouds that for a moment stain
the dusky clouds after an April storm&mdash;are they a metamorphosis
of the Pleiades? They are gone like music;
for sometimes the memory of them equals the reality and
sometimes they are not to be recalled.</p>

<p>Those Elysian, white sierras in the east, which, at the
end of a day of frowns and humours, stretch far away in
still and lucid air, their bases lost in blue, making the
world immense, as if it were to be thus for ever and the
gods to walk again.</p>

<p>The cliffs that hold the moon imprisoned in their clefts
and lure the mind to desire useless things.</p>

<p>The flocks that go down into the sea or behind the
mountains, and thrill the heart with adventurousness and
yet never move it to an adventure, but rather persuade us
to care greatly for nothing except to muse and mesmerise
ourselves with that old <span class="lock">song&mdash;</span></p>

       <div class="verse">“I did but see her passing by</div>
       <div class="verse">And yet I love her till I die.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The parcels of aerial gold which at sunset make one
canopy as of a golden-foliaged tree planted over the
world. The night does not believe that they were
ever there.</p>

<p>Those caravans that go down the blue precipices of
night intently; those dragons, lean and black, that prepare
the dawn and ruin the morning star.</p>

<p>They change, they tarry, they travel far, they pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
away, they dissolve, they cannot die. Up there, do they
think, or do they watch, or do they simply act? and is it
pleasant simply to act? Have all the sunsets and dawns
and thunderstorms done nothing for them? I suppose
that up there also nothing matters but eternity; that up
there also they know nothing of eternity.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MARSH</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The sun has gone down. Except on one hand, the
immense empty marshland expands to the sea, and where
it mingles with the grey water would be uncertain, but
for the clamour of the wading birds and the gleam, now
and then, of a white wing. The low bent thorns, inland,
now take on a strange humanity, as of men who have
ventured out into the solitude and pitched their tents
there and none has followed them; they are bent in
alarmed and hurrying attitudes away from the sea, but
cannot leave it. The sea rises steeply up like a vast
ploughed field to an uncertain sky of the same hue. All
that greyness takes hold upon the mind like autumn rain
and lures it to we know not what desperate carelessness;
and the siren, that sweet evil of the sea, chants such
dissolving melodies as <span class="lock">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>But at one hand lies the first house in the world, a
little ark of grey stone, pierced by windows behind which
a velvet darkness weaves a spell and by a gloomy doorway;
knock there and at once you will be barricaded
again against the annihilating sea and night. All about
it a trim garden of white and gold and dying red sends
up a thin tower of scent that stands bravely in the salt
wind. A tower!&mdash;at such an hour, when the easements
of all the senses are opened wide upon eternity, this perfume
not only satisfies the desiring and aspiring sense, but,
with all its unsearched, undiscovered powers, builds for us
here upon the shore a specular tower and, more, a palace
lovely and shadowy, where the mind roves slowly and at
ease, saluting vaguely apprehended shapes, finding now
long lost memories of men and things which time has
locked against a thousand keys, and now bold hopes and
unexpected consolations. Content herself lurks here and
many a pleasant ghost that seems immortal because it has
died many times, and they may be enjoyed, until suddenly
the night wind, without mercy, overturns the tower and
desolates the palace and leaves us forsaken. Yonder the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
lighthouse flashes. The ships go out with wings as of a
moth that cannot leave its chrysalis behind. The church
bells moan; the sea birds whimper and shriek, and the
road that goes on so long as we can walk lengthens out
along the marsh and up the hill.</p>

<span class="smaller">ONE SAIL AT SEA</span></h3>
</div>


<p>This is a simple world. On either hand the shore
sweeps out in a long curve and ends in a perpendicular,
ash-coloured cliff, carving the misty air as with a hatchet-stroke.
The shore is of tawny, terraced sand, like hammered
metal from the prints of the retreating waves; and
here and there a group of wildly carved and tragic stones&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unde
homines nati, durum genus</i>&mdash;such as must have been
those stones from which Deucalion made the stony race
of men to arise. Up over the sand, and among these
stones the water slides in tracery like May blossom or
silver mail. A little way out, the long wave lifts itself up
laboriously into a shadowy cliff, nods proudly and crumbles,
vain and swift, into a thousand sparks of foam. Far out
the desolate, ridgy leagues vibrate and murmur with an
unintelligible voice, not less intelligible than when one
man says, “I believe,” or another man, “I love,” or
another, “I am your friend.” Almost at the horizon a
sharp white sail sways, invisibly controlled. In a minute
it does not move; in half-an-hour it has moved. It
fascinates and becomes the image of the watcher’s hopes, as
when in some tranquil grief we wait, with faint curiosity
and sad foretelling, to see how our plans will travel,
smiling a little even when they stray or stop, because we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
foretold it. Will the sail sink? Will it take wing into
the sky? Will it go straight and far, and overcome and
celebrate its success? But it only fades away, and presently
another is there unasked, yet not surprising, and it
also fades away, and the night has come, and still the
sea speaks with tongues. In the moonlight one strange
flower glistens, white as a campanula, like a sweet-pea in
shape&mdash;the bleached thigh-bone of a rat&mdash;and we forget
the rest.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XLVI<br />

<span class="smaller">THE CASTLE OF CARBONEK</span></h3>
</div>


<p>The castle stands high among vast, sharp-edged waves of
sand at the edge of a cliff, and looks at the sea and a long,
empty shore. At its feet a little river can be seen running
in a narrow valley. A few miles off it rises in the red
moorland, then it falls with many a cascade down ladders
of crag, broadens among willows where long leaves are all
horizontal in the wind, and here by the castle it has
reached an elvish, merry old age already, as it moves clear
over the brown stones and out among the rocks to the
sea. Opposite the castle, across the river, the other side
of the valley is clothed in dense and luminous oak wood.
Where the river joins the sea both the castle hill and the
wooded hill break away into a broken multitude of bristling
rocks, and among their alleys and hidden corridors
and halls the waves leap with the motion of a herd of
ridgy cattle galloping through narrow gateways. Beyond,
and away for ten miles, the high dark coast sweeps in a
curve which the sea whitens by showing its teeth; and
round the headland at the end the ships come and go at
starry intervals. Landward, the country rises in long,
steep, furzy curves, interrupted by sudden rocks, to the
red moor and the autumn evening sky of towering,
tumultuous and yet steady grey cloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The castle stands among pale sand and long plumy
grasses. The sand is deep within the hollow and roofless
circuit of the broken walls, through which, here and there,
come glimpses of sea or sky disconnected from any fragment
of the land, so that I seem to stand between the
sea and sky. In the summer ivy-leaved toad-flax buds and
harebells, most delicate flowers, whisper from the crevices.
But nothing lives here now. The trunk of an old tree
that once grew through the walls is now so much worn
that what it was when it lived is not to be known. Not
only is all human life gone from here, but even the signs
of its decay are invisible. The noble masonry can suffer
no more except at the hands of men; it is too low and too
strong. It is a rude crag. Neither history nor legend
speaks intelligently of it. It is but known that it was
raised by hands, and each man that comes to it has to
build it again out of his own life and blood, or it remains
not far removed from nothing. The wayfarer starts at
the sight of it, tries in vain, shuddering at the cliff and the
desolate sea, to conceive a life lived by beings like himself
in such a place. To have lived there men must have had
fairy aids or the blood of witches or of gods in their
veins.</p>

<p>Here might easily have been builded in a night that
phantom palace and its illusive pomps, where the
Corinthian Lycius dwelt with the phantasmal Lamia
until a philosopher’s eye unbuilt it again.</p>

<p>Or on these sands might have stood Myratana and
blind Tiriel before the beautiful palace, and cursed their
sons.</p>

<p>When the sun has set, and land and sea are dissolved in
cold mist, all but a circle of pale sand and the castle fragment,
it seems true that here, to the foot of the tower
that is gone, came the king’s daughter and wept and
sighed and made a great moan: “Ah! he mourns not
who does not mourn for love.” And the good king came
and asked her if she desired to wed, and she answered,
“Alas, sir, yes. Ah! he mourns not who does not
mourn for love.”</p>

<p>Here, away from earth and sea and sky, apart from men
and time and any care, the melody and the picture are
truer than before, suiting that melancholy wood, in which
the heart, seeming to go back easily through unguessed
deeps of time, makes all sorrows its own, airily, not without
delight.</p>

<p>And there are others who abode here or abide here, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
for example those timeless knights of no age or clime&mdash;Pelleas,
Launcelot, Pellinore, Palomides, Galahad, whose
armour no man pretends to show us, whom old men’s
tongues and poets’ pens have lured into immortality&mdash;to
whom this castle gives a home.</p>

<p>When Launcelot had come to the water of Morteise,
says Malory, he slept, and there in a vision he was bidden
to rise and put on his armour and enter the first ship that
he found. And he did so, and the ship moved without
sail or oar, and in the ship was great sweetness so that
“he was fulfilled with all things that he thought on or
desired.” There he slept, and when he awoke there was
none on board except the dead sister of Sir Percivale; and
the ship went on for more than a month and Sir Launcelot
fed on manna, until at last he touched land and there met
Sir Galahad, his son. For half a year the two sailed together,
and “often they arrived in isles far from folk,
where there repaired none but wild beasts.” But one day
at the edge of a forest a white knight warned Sir Galahad
that he should stay with his father no more. “And therewith
Galahad entered into the forest. And the wind
arose, and drove Launcelot more than a month throughout
the sea, where he slept but little, but prayed to God that
he might see some tidings of the Sangreal. So it befell
on a night, at midnight, he arrived afore a castle, on the
back side, which was rich and fair, and there was a
postern opened towards the sea, and was open without any
keeping, save two lions kept the entry; and the moon
shone clear. Anon Sir Launcelot heard a voice that said:
Launcelot, go out of this ship and enter into the castle,
where thou shalt see a great part of thy desire. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
ran to his arms, and so armed him, and so went to the
gate and saw the lions. Then set he hand to his sword
and drew it. Then there came a dwarf suddenly, and
smote him on the arm so sore that the sword fell out of
his hand. Then heard he a voice say: O man of evil
faith and poor belief, wherefore trowest thou more on thy
harness than in thy Maker, for He might more avail thee
than thine armour, in whose service thou art set. Then
said Launcelot: Fair Father Jesu Christ, I thank Thee
of Thy great mercy that Thou reprovest me of my misdeed;
now see I well that ye hold me for your servant.
Then took he again his sword and put it up in his sheath,
and made a cross in his forehead, and came to the lions,
and they made semblaunt to do him harm. Notwithstanding
he passed by them without hurt, and entered into the
castle to the chief fortress, and there were they all at rest.
Then Launcelot entered in so armed, for he found no
gate nor door but it was open. And at the last he found
a chamber whereof the door was shut, and he set his hand
thereto to have opened it, but he might not.</p>

<p>“Then he enforced him mickle to undo the door.
Then he listened and heard a voice which sung so
sweetly that it seemed none earthly thing; and him
thought the voice said: Joy and honour be to the Father
of Heaven. Then Launcelot kneeled down before the
chamber, for well wist he that there was the Sangreal
within that chamber. Then said he: Fair sweet Father,
Jesu Christ, if ever I did thing that pleased Thee, Lord,
for Thy pity ne have me not in despite for my foul sins
done aforetime, and that Thou show me something of
that I seek. And with that he saw the chamber door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
open, and there came out a great clearness, that the
house was as bright as all the torches of the world had
been there. So came he to the chamber door and would
have entered. And anon a voice said to him: Flee,
Launcelot, and enter not, for thou oughtest not to do it;
and if thou enter thou shalt forthink it. Then he withdrew
him aback right heavy. Then looked he up in the
middle of the chamber, and saw a table of silver, and the
Holy Vessel, covered with red samite and many angels
about it, whereof one held a candle of wax burning, and
the other held a cross and the ornaments of an altar. And
before the Holy Vessel he saw a good man clothed as a
priest. And it seemed that he was at the sacring of the
mass. And it seemed to Launcelot that above the priest’s
hands were three men, whereof the two put the youngest
by likeness between the priest’s hands; and so he lift
it up right high, and it seemed to show so to the people.
And then Launcelot marvelled not a little, for him thought
the priest was so greatly charged of the figure that him
seemed that he should fall to the earth. And when he
saw none about him that would help him, then came he
to the door a great pace, and said: Fair Father Jesu
Christ, ne take it for no sin though I help the good man
which hath great need of help. Right so entered he into
the chamber, and came toward the table of silver; and
when he came nigh he felt a breath, that him thought it
was intermeddled with fire, which smote him so sore in the
visage that him thought it brent his visage; and therewith
he fell to the earth and had no power to arise; so
he was so araged, that had lost the power of his body, and
his hearing, and his seeing. Then felt he many hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
about him, which took him up and bare him out of the
chamber door, without any amending of his swoon, and
left him there, seeming dead to all people. So upon the
morrow when it was fair day they within were arisen, and
found Launcelot lying afore the chamber door. All they
marvelled how that he came in, and so they looked upon
him, and felt his pulse to wit whether there were any
life in him; and so they found life in him, but he might
not stand nor stir no member that he had. And so they
took him by every part of the body, and bare him into
a chamber, and laid him in a rich bed, far from all folk;
and so he lay four days. Then the one said he was alive,
and the other said, nay. In the name of God, said an old
man, for I do you verily to wit he is not dead, but he is
so full of life as the mightiest of you all; and therefore I
counsel you that he be well kept till God send him life
again.</p>

<p>“In such manner they kept Launcelot four-and-twenty
days and all so many nights, that ever he lay still
as a dead man; and at the twenty-fifth day befell him
after midday that he opened his eyes, and when he saw
folk he made great sorrow, and said: Why have ye
awaked me, for I was more at ease than I am now. O
Jesu Christ, who might be so blessed that might see
openly thy great marvels of secretness there where no
sinner may be! What have ye seen? said they
about him. I have seen, said he, so great marvels that
no tongue may tell, and more than any heart can think,
and had not my son been here afore me I had seen
much more. Then they told him how he had lain
there four-and-twenty days and nights. Then him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
thought it was punishment for the four-and-twenty
years that he had been a sinner, wherefore our Lord put
him in penance four-and-twenty days and nights. Then
looked Sir Launcelot afore him, and saw the hair which
he had borne nigh a year, for that he forthought him
right much that he had broken his promise unto the
hermit, which he had avowed to do. Then they asked
how it stood with him. Forsooth, said he, I am whole of
body, thanked be our Lord; therefore, sirs, for God’s
love tell me where I am. Then said they all that he was
in the Castle of Carbonek.”</p>

<p>And when the moon is clear, and the tingling sea is
vast and alone, this castle on the sand above the grim
coast is Carbonek, meet for all adventures and all dreams.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
